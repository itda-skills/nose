Soundness of nose's commutative/associative operand canonicalization.

The value graph canonicalizes an associative-commutative operator chain (e.g. `+`) by
FLATTENING it to its leaf operands and SORTING them by a structural hash
(`value_graph.rs`: `flatten_into` + `operands.sort_by_key`). For this to be sound the
fingerprint must be invariant to that rewrite, i.e. the rewrite must preserve behavior.

This file proves exactly that for `+` over `Int`: flattening an add-tree to a leaf list
preserves its denotation, and ANY permutation of that leaf list (the sort is one) has the
same denotation. Hence sorting flattened `+`-operands is denotation-preserving — sound.

/-- MAIN: the value graph's flatten-then-sort canonicalization of an AC `+` chain is
    denotation-preserving. If `e₂`'s flattened leaves are a permutation of `e₁`'s
    (which sorting guarantees — both sort to the same order), then `e₁` and `e₂` have
    equal denotation on every environment. Fingerprint-equal ⇒ behavior-equal, for this
    rule. -/

/-- DISTRIBUTION / FACTORING IS SOUND: the value graph factors a shared multiplicand out
    of a sum of products — `x*f + y*f → (x+y)*f` (`value_graph.rs::factor_distribute`).
    Over `Int` (the value graph gates this on every leaf being proven `Num`) this is
    denotation-preserving, so the factored and expanded forms fingerprint-equal ⇒
    behavior-equal. The string/list `*`-as-repetition monoid is NOT a ring, which is why
    the Rust rewrite refuses to fire unless all leaves are numeric. -/

    eval env (.mul (.add x y) f) = eval env (.add (.mul x f) (.mul y f)) := by
