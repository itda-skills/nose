Soundness of nose's categorical (functor-law) canonicalizations on map/filter pipelines.

The value graph fuses higher-order pipelines via the laws of the list functor:
  • map fusion     `map g (map f xs) = map (g∘f) xs`     (value_graph.rs `elem`: Elem(Map f c) → f·)
  • filter fusion  `filter q (filter p xs) = filter (λx. p x ∧ q x) xs`

This file proves both laws hold for `List`, so the fusions are denotation-preserving —
the converged pipelines compute the same result.

    fusing nested filters via `and_preds` (`value_graph.rs` `HoFKind::Filter` arm), so
    `filter(q, filter(p, xs))`, `[x for x in xs if p if q]`, and the filtered builder loop
    all converge to one `Hof(Map, [Elem xs, p∧q])`. Denotation-preserving — sound. -/
