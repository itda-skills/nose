# Changelog

All notable changes to nose are documented here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); pre-1.0, so minor versions may
break.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Soundness:** five fingerprint erasure classes no longer collapse working code
  onto stubs (#210, experiments §BP): Python `try/except/else` kept its `else`
  clause (black's try/import wrapper ≡ `return self`); Ruby `begin/rescue/else`
  moved `else` out of handler position; C/Go/Rust dereference STORES stay
  computed places (`(*nr)++` merged with bare `return 0` stubs — 38 pairs in git
  alone); Go type-switch arms survive lowering (a recursive traversal merged
  with a constant stub at exact-safe); try handlers are erased only for provably
  non-throwing bodies; element-free loop effects are keyed by the iteration
  source (for-in keys vs for-of values); and the oracle respects declared
  parameter type domains plus 2-arg scalar min/max arity. `nose verify` now
  reports zero hard violations on all 105 corpus repos.
- The verify oracle's hard SOUND gate is scoped to the product's exact claim
  (`exact_claim_eligible` in nose-detect: strict-exact-safe + the
  degenerate-fingerprint size floor); lossy-fingerprint collisions are a
  diagnostics lane and declaration-divergent or symbolic disagreements are
  advisory leads, so the gate measures exactly what the exact channel asserts.
- Combining `--mode syntax,semantic` no longer drops an exact semantic family when
  the syntax channel also creates a same-file window that collapses to one reported
  site. Such single-site windows are not clone families and no longer participate
  in rank-time overlap subsumption, so adding the syntax channel cannot erase an
  otherwise reported semantic region.
- Scan JSON `family_id` values are now unique for distinct reported families that
  share the same files and symbol names but point at different spans, especially
  hidden exact-fragment families. The ID now includes each member's displayed
  path, language, span, unit kind, symbol name, and fragment proof metadata; old
  baselines can still classify re-keyed overlapping families as `changed`, but
  structured ignores by `family_id` may need a one-time refresh.
- Fresh benchmark-corpus reconstruction works again: `bench/setup_repos.sh`
  now has its missing file-level prune helper checked in, guards that the helper
  exists before cloning, and writes a deterministic
  `bench/labels/prune_manifest.json` audit artifact with a post-prune corpus
  digest.
- Semantic scans no longer stack-overflow when a recursive helper is referenced
  from inside one of its own callback bodies while extracting a block or exact
  fragment. The value graph now excludes the enclosing function/method from the
  per-unit inline registry, preserving bounded inlining for sub-unit
  fingerprints. This fixes the `rxjs` corpus crash and keeps the 105-repo bench
  corpus green in semantic JSON mode.
- **Soundness:** a seeded selection loop (`best = 0; … if v > best: best = v`) no
  longer merges with the true builtin selection (`max(…)`) — the seed clamps the
  result (empty or all-negative input returns the seed), so it is
  behavior-defining. Selection reductions now carry their seed in the value
  fingerprint; equally-seeded loops still converge with each other. Found by
  `nose verify` the moment 2-argument `min`/`max` became interpretable; the
  mislabeled adversarial benchmark case was flipped to a hard negative.
- **Soundness:** Python `//` no longer shares a fingerprint with `/`. Floor division
  is its own IL operator (`FloorDiv`, quotient toward −∞) with matching interpreter
  semantics, so `5 / 2` (2.5) can never merge with `5 // 2` (2).
- **Soundness:** JS/TS `>>>` (zero-fill shift) no longer collapses onto `>>`
  (sign-extending shift); Python `@` (matmul) no longer collapses onto `*`. Both
  keep a raw shape keyed by their own operator spelling.
- **Soundness:** a strict null check (`x === null` / `x !== null`) no longer merges
  with the nullish family (`x ?? d`, `x == null ? d : x`) — strict and loose checks
  differ on every `undefined` input. `=== undefined` against a proven typed
  `Map.get` result still converges with `??` (there the strict check is the
  faithful absence test). `x ?? d` still converges with `x == null ? d : x`.
- **Soundness:** compound assignments with an operator the IL does not model no
  longer silently degrade: JS `x ??= y` now desugars to `x = x ?? y` (it lowered
  as `x += y`); Java `x >>>= y` lowered as `x = y`; unmapped operators across
  Python/JS/Go/Rust/Java/C/Ruby now keep a raw shape keyed by the operator
  spelling instead of defaulting to `Add` or plain assignment.
- Two different unmapped binary operators over the same operands no longer share a
  raw fingerprint — the raw fallback now keys by the operator spelling.
- The interpreter oracle evaluates 2-argument `min`/`max` (the 2-way selection
  `[a, b].min()` canonicalizes to) instead of erring — closing an oracle blind
  spot on exactly the convergences the value graph claims.

### Added
- Ruby `**` now lowers to the shared exponentiation operator and converges with
  Python/JS `**`.
- Compact CLI regression fixtures now pin the real-corpus strict-nullish hard
  negatives: `x ?? d` / `x == null ? d : x` stay separate from `x === null ? d :
  x`, and loose `!= null` object guards stay out of the strict non-null object
  guard family.
- Scan JSON `ranking` now includes `surface_counts`, a pre-`--top` breakdown of
  `default`, `review`, `hidden`, and `debug` families plus the same breakdown for
  exact-fragment families. This makes the human-action surface explicit for
  integrations that should filter `recommended_surface == "default"`.
- A three-reviewer fragment-quality audit artifact for Java/Python hidden/review
  exact-fragment families now records the criteria, votes, and policy decisions
  behind the diagnostic-surface follow-up.
- A LawPack provenance audit artifact now records the 105-repo and targeted
  real-corpus pass for `nose.value_graph.laws`: the pack is active in scan JSON,
  but the current two proof-backed laws produced no real clone families with
  `semantic_laws` provenance.
- The design §5 recall-ceiling probe (`bench/labels/recall_ceiling_probe.py` plus
  its dated artifact) now measures the residual sub-DAG / pure-inlining recall
  headroom on the v5 gold set: a 2.0% optimistic ceiling (0.6% at the shipped
  anchor weight), answering the recall-mechanism gate no-go and routing the
  residual to unit-extraction coverage and the fragment statement-window axis
  (experiments §BJ).
- An independent miss-mining arm (`bench/type4/miss_mining.py` plus its dated
  artifact) now measures in-the-wild unreported same-computation pairs beyond
  the nose ∪ jscpd label pool: 593 detector-suggested candidates corpus-wide,
  audited as overwhelmingly generated/scaffolding with a handful of
  worthy-shaped misses — and the audit exposed the #202 channel-merge family
  drop (experiments §BK).
- An oracle exclusion census (`nose verify --exclusion-census`, merged by
  `bench/labels/merge_exclusion_census.py`) now baselines real-corpus oracle
  coverage: 4.5% of function units are interpretable and 90.8% of
  fingerprint-equal pair mass carries no behavioral check, with opaque calls and
  field reads as the dominant, structure-keyed coverage targets. The companion
  `--leads` merge records 179 behavior-equal fingerprint-split groups (5 with
  vj ≥ 0.7) as convergence leads (experiments §BL).
- The interpreter oracle now models opaque calls and unproven field reads as
  identified SYMBOLIC values (recorded in the ordered effect trace) instead of
  bailing the whole unit: real-corpus oracle coverage rose from 4.5% to 29.4%
  of function units, and oracle-verified fingerprint-merge pairs from 9.2% to
  31.3%. Symbolic-trace disagreements go to a separate advisory lane — the hard
  SOUND gate and canon-preservation stay concrete-only, and the completeness /
  under-merge direction keeps its concrete meaning (experiments §BL.1). The
  corpus pass also exposed a pre-existing degenerate-fingerprint false-merge
  class, filed as #210.

### Changed
- Tiny test-only exact-fragment scaffolding now stays on the hidden diagnostic surface
  instead of the review surface: all-test fragments with enclosing context and mean span
  ≤3 lines, plus all-test effect/body fragments up to 4 lines. Larger test setup
  fragments remain available for review.

### Performance
- Minified-bundle-sized files no longer hit a quadratic cliff: `nearest_scope`
  and evidence-record lookups were per-query linear scans over all IL
  nodes/records and are now lazy per-file indexes. A 246 KB minified JS file
  went from 227 s to ≈ 2 s in normalize+extract (~118×), and ordinary repos get
  ~3× faster normalize+extract. Profiler-driven (`sample` + `NOSE_TIME=1`).
- Large Java test files with many imported API occurrences no longer spend
  minutes revalidating the same import-shadow proof. Imported occurrence
  validation now reuses a per-file function/local-shadow cache; the
  `commons-lang` semantic scan outlier went from ≈119 s to <1 s in
  normalize+extract, with identical family ids.

### Removed
- Pre-release compat shims: `seq_surface_contract_evidence_for_node`,
  `unshadowed_global_symbol` (spelling fallback), `builtin_demand` and the legacy
  `BuiltinDemand` enum (superseded by `builtin_demand_profile`), the superseded
  `lcs_ratio` scorer, the unused `minhash::estimate`, and the never-constructed
  `EvidenceEmitter::Legacy` variant.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- Strict Type-4 proof facts for case-sensitive string prefix/suffix predicates across
  Go, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Ruby, Rust, and embedded script surfaces.
  The benchmark now includes same-surface and cross-surface positives plus affix,
  direction, and wrong-receiver hard negatives.
- Strict Type-4 proof facts for static literal collection membership across Go,
  JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Ruby, Rust, and embedded script surfaces. The detector
  now converges Python `in`, literal receiver `includes/include?/contains`, and Go
  `slices.Contains` while keeping substring contains and arbitrary receiver contains
  outside strict semantic reporting.
- Strict Type-4 proof facts for typed dynamic collection membership across Go, Java,
  Python, Rust, and TypeScript. Frontends now preserve coarse parameter semantic facts
  from explicit type annotations, and exact semantic mode uses them to converge
  collection membership APIs while keeping typed string receivers and wrong-element
  boundaries distinct.
- Strict Type-4 proof facts for proven Set membership. Exact semantic mode now
  converges typed TypeScript `Set<T>.has(value)`, inline `new Set([...]).has(value)`,
  and immutable local `Set` construction with the corresponding collection-membership
  predicates, while preserving wrong-element, wrong-collection, shadowed-constructor,
  untyped-receiver, and map-key-membership boundaries.
- Strict Type-4 proof facts for Java literal collection factories. Exact semantic mode
  now converges `List.of(...).contains(value)`, `Set.of(...).contains(value)`, and
  `Arrays.asList(...).contains(value)` with static literal collection membership, while
  preserving wrong-element, wrong-collection, local name shadowing, and same-file type
  shadowing boundaries.
- Strict Type-4 proof facts for literal Python/Ruby map lookup with fallback. The detector
  now converges dict `.get(key, default)` and hash `.fetch(key, default)` only when the
  receiver is a static literal map, preserving wrong-key, wrong-default, and wrong-map
  boundaries.
- Strict Type-4 proof facts for JavaScript/TypeScript `Map` construction default
  lookups. Exact semantic mode now converges inline `new Map([...]).get(key) ?? fallback`,
  immutable local `Map` construction, and proven `has/get` ternaries with literal
  Python/Ruby map defaults, while preserving wrong-key, wrong-default, wrong-map,
  untyped-receiver, and shadowed-`Map` boundaries.
- Strict Type-4 proof facts for JavaScript/TypeScript object-literal default
  lookups guarded by own-property checks. Exact semantic mode now converges
  `Object.hasOwn`, `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call`, and negated own-property
  ternaries over static object literals with literal Python/Ruby map defaults,
  while preserving wrong-key, wrong-default, wrong-map, unguarded index default,
  prototype-aware `in`, direct `hasOwnProperty`, and shadowed-`Object` boundaries.
- Strict Type-4 proof facts for null/none/nil/option presence predicates. The detector
  now converges explicit null comparisons with Ruby `nil?` and Rust `is_none`/`is_some`
  method forms plus Rust `if let Some(_)`/`if let None` pattern predicates, while
  preserving non-null direction and wrong-value boundaries.
- Strict Type-4 proof facts for value-or-fallback defaulting across JavaScript/TypeScript
  nullish forms and Rust `Option` APIs. The detector now converges `??`, explicit
  nullish ternaries/guard returns, `unwrap_or`, capture-only `unwrap_or_else`, and
  identity `map_or`, while preserving truthy-or, wrong-fallback, and wrong-value
  boundaries.
- Strict Type-4 proof facts for scalar numeric idioms across C, Go, Java,
  JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Ruby, and embedded script surfaces. The detector now converges
  explicit sign-normalizing conditionals with safe `abs`/`Math.abs`/`math.Abs` forms, and
  scalar two-way `min`/`max` conditionals with proven builtin and method forms including Ruby
  `value.abs`, Ruby two-element `[left, right].min/.max`, and Rust numeric
  `.abs()/.min()/.max()`, while preserving signed-identity, wrong-value, min/max
  direction, shadowed-`Math`, and Rust custom-method boundaries.
- Strict Type-4 proof facts for map key-membership predicates across Go, Java, Python,
  Ruby, Rust, and typed TypeScript `Map` receivers. The detector now converges
  `key in map`, map key APIs, Java `keySet().contains`, Rust `get(key).is_some`,
  TypeScript `Map.has`, and Go `_, ok := map[key]` while preserving wrong-key,
  wrong-map, and value-membership boundaries.
- Strict Type-4 proof facts for typed map lookup with fallback across Go, Java,
  Rust, and typed TypeScript `Map` receivers. The detector now converges Go
  lookup-ok fallback assignments, Java `containsKey/get` and `getOrDefault`,
  Rust `contains_key`/index and `get(key).unwrap_or(default)`, and TypeScript
  `Map.get(key) ?? fallback`, `has/get` ternaries, and temp-bound undefined guards
  while preserving wrong-key, wrong-default, wrong-map, and untyped-receiver
  boundaries.
- Strict semantic block extraction no longer treats expression ternaries as
  sub-function block units. This keeps exact semantic block candidates focused on
  real statement blocks and prevents proof-context-free expression fragments from
  bypassing function-level type facts.
- Type-4 focused generation filters (`--axis`, `--proposal-prefix`) and smoke gates
  (`GATE=focused|core|full`) so detector co-evolution loops can run on one frontier
  before periodic compact/full validation.
- Type-4 frontier preflight (`bench/type4/preflight_axis.py`) to reject benchmark-only
  loops when the baseline already covers all strict positives or when a candidate does
  not improve recall or remove baseline false merges without candidate false merges.

### Changed
- Type-4 frontier prioritization now separates true uncovered broad-probe gaps from
  filtered probe overreach, so pattern loops do not promote non-strict examples just
  to improve apparent coverage.
- Type-4 frontier prioritization can now reuse cached corpus analysis and reports top
  matching repos per candidate for targeted real-repo audits.
- Type-4 manifest evaluation and frontier summaries now index scan locations by file,
  making full-manifest validation practical after corpus growth.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Exact Type-4 (semantic-clone) convergence pass** — more behaviorally-equivalent
  code now converges to one value-fingerprint, with each new algebraic law
  machine-checked in Lean and the soundness contract held (full-corpus `nose verify`
  stays **0 false merges**, canon-preserved):
  - **Distribution / factoring** `a*c + b*c ≡ (a+b)*c` (numeric, Lean `distrib_sound`)
    and full associative-commutative flatten+sort in the value graph itself.
  - **Filter fusion** `filter q (filter p) ≡ filter (p∧q)` via an element-carrying
    filter representation (Lean `filter_fusion`) — unifies nested filters, a
    `.filter().filter()` chain, and the filtered builder loop.
  - **Reduce-lambda selection** (`reduce(λ. a if a>b else b) ≡ max`), **count-of-filter**
    (`len([… if p]) ≡ Σ(p?1:0)`, Lean `filter_length_eq_count`), and Rust method-form
    iterator reductions (`.sum()/.min()/.max()/.count()`).
  - **Dict-builder loop ≡ dict comprehension** (`d={}; for x: d[k]=v` ≡ `{k: v for x}`)
    via a `DictEntry`-distinct representation that cannot collide with a list of tuples.
  - **Stronger IL type inference** — a fixpoint over subexpression result types — gating
    the numeric rewrites soundly.

### Formal
- New machine-checked Lean proofs: `NoseAlgebra.distrib_sound`,
  `NoseFunctor.{filter_fusion, filter_length_eq_count}`, and the
  `normalize.value_graph.compare` obligation (comparison-direction and
  negated-comparison canons). A CI `formal` job checks the proof-obligation registry
  and all `formal/**/*.lean` files on every push.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-04

### Changed
- **`nose scan --mode` is now channel-based**: `syntax` (Type-1/2 copy-paste),
  `semantic` (exact value-fingerprint Type-4), and `near` (Type-3 fuzzy
  near-duplicates). Omitting `--mode` runs `syntax,semantic`; specifying `--mode`
  runs exactly the comma-separated/repeated channels provided.
- Removed the old `cpd`, `refactor`, `behavior`, and `behavior-strict` scan modes
  and removed `--no-contiguous`. `--threshold` is now valid only when `near` is
  enabled.
- The `near` channel now uses shape-based candidate generation, so Type-3 edits
  that change value fingerprints still reach fuzzy scoring instead of being
  filtered out before scoring.
- Documentation and CLI help now spell out that omitting `--mode` means
  `syntax,semantic`, while specifying `--mode` replaces that default exactly.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed
- **`nose scan --top 0` now shows all families**, as `docs/usage.md` and
  `docs/benchmark.md` document. The code used `.take(top)` with no special case,
  so `--top 0` silently returned an empty report; `0` is now treated as unlimited,
  the flag help says so, and a regression test covers it.

### Docs
- Documented Homebrew / prebuilt-binary install and the cargo-dist release process
  (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
- Added `AGENTS.md` (with `CLAUDE.md` as a symlink) per the Corca convention; the
  release process now includes the CHANGELOG step that this release recovers.

### Tooling & quality gates
- **`awiki` docs-wiki connectivity gate** — `awiki lint --root docs` keeps `docs/`
  a single connected graph (no orphan pages). Wired into `scripts/check-docs.sh`,
  `scripts/check.sh`, the `.githooks/pre-commit` hook, and the CI `docs` job, using
  the same skipped-with-notice pattern as the other optional-tool gates.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- **`nose scan --mode`** — four explicit scan modes: `cpd` (copy-paste channel only,
  jscpd-style CI gate), `refactor` (the default broad refactoring-candidate workflow),
  `behavior` (strict behavioral scorer with the calibrated 0.86 threshold), and
  `behavior-strict` (exact value-fingerprint Type-4 matches plus the copy-paste floor,
  with no fuzzy similarity threshold).
- **Independent soundness oracle** (`nose verify`) — the value-graph contract is
  *fingerprint-equal ⟹ behavior-equal*; a tree-walking interpreter runs every unit on an
  input battery and flags any fingerprint-equal pair whose behavior differs. It interprets
  the **pre-canonicalization core IL** (not the IL it fingerprints), so a behavior-changing
  canon cannot mask itself, plus a **canon-preservation** check (core-IL behavior must
  equal full-IL behavior — catches a bad canon with no colliding twin). Both report zero
  violations. See Experiments §AJ/§AX.
- **Machine-checked canons** (`formal/`, Lean 4) — the core algebraic/control/functor/
  min-max/boolean-reduction canonicalizations are proven behavior-preserving (no `sorry`):
  AC-operand canon, `sub`→`add+neg`, neg-distribution, guard-clause, dead-code-after-return,
  ternary-return decomposition, map fusion/identity, min/max monoid, and the `any`/`all`
  OR/AND monoids.
- **Purpose-fit type inference** (`types.rs`) — infers `Num | Bool | Str | List | Unknown`
  per parameter from strictly-typed uses, gating the type-dependent canons (commutativity,
  identity elimination, double-negation, idempotence).
- **Cross-language `any`/`all`** — Python `any(p(x) for x in xs)`, JS `xs.some(p)`, and
  Rust `xs.iter().any(p)` (and `all`/`every`/`.all`) converge to one canonical boolean
  short-circuit reduction. Free-monoid string model, map/filter fusion, and a
  ternary-return decomposition (`return a if c else b` ↔ `if c {return a} else {return b}`)
  also landed on the value graph.
- **`nose scan`** — ranked architecture/design-level refactoring candidates.
  Human / JSON / Markdown / SARIF output; `--diff` shows source diffs between
  representatives, `--proposal` shows extraction skeletons with the differing parts
  marked as parameters.
- **`nose scan --sort`** — `extractability` (default), `value`, or `sites`.
  The default ranks by how cleanly a family folds into one helper — *invariant*
  (shared) lines × copies × spread, weighted by **tightness** (shared/total: 22 shared
  of 384 lines is 6% invariant — barely a dedup) and penalized by parameter count —
  instead of raw duplicated volume, which over-rewards a big block whose copies share
  little. The all-type-definition / all-generated **discount and `.d.ts` exclusion**
  now apply to extractability too (they previously only touched `value`). Same-language
  families with **no** shared invariant lines (a language idiom like Go
  `if err != nil { return err }`, or two unrelated type literals of the same shape) have
  nothing to extract and sink to the bottom — they no longer top the list at a
  misleading `sim 1.00`. Field evaluation across six real projects drove these fixes.
- **Honest shared-line reporting** — the report's similarity cell now shows `N/M
  shared · Pp` (invariant lines of total, with P parameter spots) for same-language
  families, computed by the same anti-unification as `--proposal`. Replaces a bare
  `sim 1.00` that read as "identical" even when two copies shared only a handful of
  literal lines (a dispatch skeleton over divergent bodies). Cross-language families,
  which share no *source* lines, still show structural `sim`.
- **`scanned N files` scope line** — `scan`'s human/Markdown output now opens with the
  file count and per-language breakdown (e.g. `scanned 1113 files · typescript 900 · tsx
  213`). A repo whose `.gitignore`/`--exclude` pruned vendored or generated code scans
  far fewer files than sit on disk; the count makes that scope explicit instead of a
  silent gap. JSON/SARIF output is unaffected; the language breakdown is omitted under
  `--cache-dir` (which tracks only the count).
- **Refactoring-candidate mode** (`--candidates` on `detect`, default for `scan`):
  gates off + lower threshold, ~99% review-worthy on a refactoring-worthiness rubric.
- **Rust, Java, C, and Ruby frontends** — 8 base languages (Python, JS, TS, Go,
  Rust, Java, C, Ruby). Cross-language convergence (a Rust/Java/C/Ruby accumulator
  loop normalizes to the same IL as the Python one).
- **JSX/TSX, and embedded `<script>` in Vue / Svelte / HTML.** The embedded frontend
  extracts each `<script>` block and blanks the surrounding markup to whitespace
  (newlines kept), so the script parses as JS/TS in place with exact line numbers;
  `lang="ts"` selects TypeScript. The same logic in a `.ts`, `.vue`, `.svelte`, and
  `.html` file forms one cross-container clone family.
- `nose scan --min-value V` to hide low-value families (noise floor on large repos).
- `nose scan --hotspots` — architecture view ranking directories by the lines that
  sit in a clone family (e.g. surfaces `zod/.../locales`, translation/locale dirs).
- Per-family **refactoring hint** (e.g. "consolidate `name` — N copies", "extract a shared
  base class / mixin", cross-language flag) and the languages a cross-language family spans.
- `--version`; richer CLI help; LICENSE.

### Changed
- **Contiguous copy-paste channel is same-language by construction** — its k-gram
  table is keyed by `(hash, language)`, so a literal-copy-paste family can no longer
  span languages (you don't copy-paste TS into a `.mjs`; cross-language equivalence is
  Type-4, recovered by the value-graph channel). Removes a class of false cross-language
  merges (unrelated functions grouped by a shared normalized-IL token run) that the new
  ranking couldn't catch — cross-language families bypass the shared-line check. Also
  stops a collision in one language from masking a real same-language match in another.
- **Overlapping families merge** — a family whose sites are a window-shifted overlap
  (≥60%) of a larger family's sites is now subsumed, not reported twice. Previously
  only strict containment collapsed; the contiguous channel finding the same run at a
  few different start lines surfaced as several near-identical families.
- **`.gitignore` is respected even outside a git checkout** (`require_git(false)` on
  the walker), so an extracted tarball / vendored sub-tree honors its own `.gitignore`
  instead of leaking generated and vendored files into the report.
- **Detector modes split**: strict behavioral-clone mode (precision gates on, the
  default for `detect`) vs candidate mode. Behavioral precision raised ~6%→~78%
  (unbiased, judge-validated) via string-literal value retention, RANSAC re-weighting,
  data-table & return-signature gates, class-attribute capture in the value graph.
- Default behavioral threshold 0.86 (balanced operating point from the precision curve).
- **Refactoring value is fanout-aware**: the copy count is dampened beyond a small
  knee (square-root tail), so a fragment repeated across hundreds of sites
  (generated boilerplate, test scaffolding) no longer dominates the ranking over
  genuine few-site refactors. Fixed garbage-at-top on large corpora (a 421-site
  Javadoc family and a 541-site spec-scaffolding family ranked #1–2). The reported
  `dup_lines` estimate is unchanged (honest `mean_lines × (members−1)`); only the
  ranking score is dampened.
- **Contiguous copy-paste channel is value-sensitive**: it now keys on literal
  *values* (string hash / int / bool), not the abstract literal class, so two
  *different* data tables (distinct HTML-entity / locale maps) no longer collapse
  into one giant cross-file/cross-language family. Aligns the channel with how a
  raw-token detector behaves; token-detector-superset coverage held at 90.9%.

### Fixed
- **`--cache-dir` no longer drops copy-paste clones.** The on-disk cache stored only
  each file's value-graph units, so a cached run executed *only* the value-graph
  channel and silently omitted every contiguous (Type-1/2 copy-paste) family —
  e.g. radash reported 148 families uncached but 92 with `--cache-dir`, despite the
  cache being documented as a transparent speed-up. The cache now also stores each
  file's contiguous token stream (content-derived, so cacheable by source hash like
  the units), and the copy-paste channel runs from it. Cached output is byte-identical
  to a normal scan again (verified across the corpus). Cache schema bumped, so existing
  caches repopulate.
- **Byte-identical output restored across thread counts.** Three latent
  nondeterminism sources let `scan`/`verify` output vary with `RAYON_NUM_THREADS`
  (and the per-process hash seed) on some repos, violating the determinism
  guarantee: (1) the honest shared-line ranking summed `idf` weights over lines in
  `HashMap` order, so float-add non-associativity perturbed `shared_weight` (and,
  via sort ties, family order); (2) the RANSAC aligner picked its consensus offset
  with `max_by_key(votes)`, and a vote-count tie resolved by the reused thread-local
  map's capacity-dependent iteration order — fixed by breaking ties on the offset
  value; (3) `nose verify`'s under-merged-clones diagnostic iterated `HashMap`s into
  its output. A determinism sweep over the 105-repo corpus now reports **0**
  nondeterministic repos for `scan` and `detect` (was 4 for `scan`). A stronger
  cross-thread-count regression test (8 families × 5 near-duplicate copies) guards
  the class.
- **`--proposal` no longer overstates family-wide overlap.** The skeleton is a
  pairwise anti-unification of the two largest copies; for families with more copies
  it now says so (`… of the 2 largest of N copies; the rest may share fewer`), so it
  no longer silently contradicts the family summary's majority-shared count.
- Refactoring families collapse overlapping/nested sites (a function and its inner
  block, or near-identical off-by-one spans) into one site — accurate site counts
  and dup-line estimates.
- **Value-graph soundness — the "treat a non-commutative op as commutative" bug class**
  (Experiments §AX). The independent oracle (above) exposed a class of latent false merges
  the old same-IL oracle had masked — 11 fingerprint collisions, plus 20 behavior-changing
  units the new canon-preservation check caught — all fixed at the root: short-circuit
  value-`and`/`or` are
  associative but NOT commutative (`1 or 2`≠`2 or 1`) — no longer sorted, and now correctly
  lazy in the interpreter; `!!x` is `bool(x)` not `x` (cancelled only on Bool);
  `not(Err)` propagates the error instead of yielding `true`; `x+0`/`x*1` identity
  elimination is dropped (unsound for non-Num, and untypeable — the optimistic inference
  would self-justify it); and string `+` (concatenation) operands are never reordered. A new
  negated-comparison canon (`!(a<=b)`→`a>b`) converges what double-negation pushes.
- **Value-graph soundness — eight false merges fixed** (behaviorally-different code
  that shared a fingerprint; the behavioral fingerprint is sound by intent, see
  Experiments §AS/§AT and the Normalization soundness note): loop iteration-extent was
  dropped (`range(len)` ≡ `range(1,len)`, `i+=1` ≡ `i+=2`, early `break` ≡ full loop);
  slice/range bounds collapsed (`a[1:]` ≡ `a[:1]` in Python/Go/Rust, `1..2` ≡ `1..=2`);
  alpha-renaming collapsed distinct globals/callees (`foo(x)` ≡ `bar(x)`, `max` ≡ `min`);
  boolean literal *values* were discarded (`True` ≡ `False`); and `in`/`is` → `Op::Eq`
  merged membership with equality and dropped negation (`x is not None` ≡ `x is None`).
  Fixes added `Op::In` (non-commutative, list-membership interpretable) and
  `Payload::LitBool`, and made the slice/`range`/`++` lowerings position- and
  value-preserving. Each has a `tests/equivalence.rs` reproducer.
- **Convergence bugs surfaced by cross-language tests** (each broke matching):
  - Rust `*x` deref was mislowered as `UnOp(Neg)`; now peels to its operand (`*x > 0`
    matches a plain `x > 0`).
  - Python f-strings (`f"hi {name}"`) and Ruby interpolation (`"hi #{name}"`) dropped
    the interpolated expression, lowering to an opaque literal; both now lower to a
    string-concat chain that converges with a JS template literal.
  - `cfg_norm` branch orientation inverted comparisons to non-canonical operators
    (`Lt`→`Ge`), so `if a<b {X} else {Y}` never converged with `if a>=b {Y} else {X}`;
    it now stays in the canonical `Lt`/`Le`/`Eq`/`Ne` set (operands swapped as needed).
  - Python `lambda x: e` lowered a bare-expression body while JS arrows wrap theirs
    in `Block(Return(e))`; the lambda now uses the same canonical shape, so
    `lambda x: e` ≡ `x => e`.
- A convergence test matrix (one algorithm × N languages → one IL hash) now guards
  these and the documented equivalences (loop forms, ternary/switch, comprehension/
  `.map`, conjoined/continue guards, De Morgan, optional chaining, try/except).

### Performance
- RANSAC alignment reuses per-thread scratch (scoring −37%).
- Threshold early-exit skips alignment for un-acceptable pairs (scoring 4–6× faster).
- Thread-local parser pool: one `tree_sitter::Parser` per grammar per worker instead
  of one per file (lowering ~1.8× faster — the dominant stage on large corpora).
- Every pipeline stage is parallel: parallel file discovery (`ignore`'s walker),
  sort-based parallel LSH candidate-gen (22→6 ms), fused normalize+extract (~halves
  peak IL memory). parse+lower scales 11.6× on 18 cores. **~14k → ~19.5k files/sec**
  on the 3620-file corpus; deterministic across runs, threads, *and* machines.
- `nose scan --cache-dir <dir>` — opt-in on-disk cache of per-file units keyed
  by content hash; ~1.6× faster re-runs on unchanged files (output byte-identical).

### Tooling & quality gates
- Centralized `[workspace.lints]` (rust + clippy) inherited by every crate;
  `unsafe_code = "forbid"`. `unreachable_pub` narrowed 73 over-exposed `pub` items
  to `pub(crate)`.
- `cargo-machete` (unused-dependency gate) — removed 3 unused deps.
- `cargo-deny` (`deny.toml`): security advisories, license allow-list, no
  duplicate/wildcard deps, crates.io-only sources.
- Broken-intra-doc-link gate (`RUSTDOCFLAGS=-D warnings cargo doc`); fixed the links
  it caught.
- **Copy-paste gate** (`scripts/check-duplication.sh`) — nose run on its own source,
  ratcheted to a committed budget; the clone detector polices its own duplication.
- `rust-toolchain.toml` pins the dev/CI toolchain (1.96.0); **MSRV 1.85** declared
  (`rust-version`) and checked by a dedicated CI job (floor set by the dependency
  tree's `edition2024` requirement).
- One-command local runner `scripts/check.sh`; all gates wired into CI; documented
  in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Automated dependency updates via Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`).
- **IR verifier** (`Il::validate`) run under `debug_assert!` after normalization —
  the LLVM-`verify`/MIR-validator analogue. Normalization proven idempotent
  (fixpoint) by test.

### Internal
- Self-hosted benchmark corpus under `bench/repos` (pinned commits; see
  `bench/setup_repos.sh`) — no dependency on sibling projects.
- Dogfooded on its own code (`docs/dogfooding.md`); acted on real findings — extracted
  shared `lower::{binary, while_loop, collect_into, function_unit, switch_to_if_chain,
  lower_file}` and `normalize::collect_scope` across the frontends/passes.
