"""Corpus-balanced Type-4 frontier evidence platform (issue #44).

This is a *companion* to ``prioritize_frontier.py``. It reuses that tool's candidate
and probe definitions (the single source of truth for what each semantic axis matches)
but answers a different question: **which semantic invariants can we trust as the next
Type-4 expansion target, and which must we NOT trust yet** — recorded reproducibly, with
language/repo bias removed.

It deliberately keeps two layers apart (issue #44 / #36 decision):

* **Queue signal** — regex *presence* of an axis across the pinned 105-repo corpus. This
  is prevalence, not proof. It can SUGGEST "covered / likely miss / needs audit" but it
  NEVER finalizes a structured frontier status.
* **Evidence layer** — ``real_frontier.v1.json`` records, which are human-verified with a
  detector run and a proof invariant. This tool only *reads* that layer (to mark which
  axes already carry human evidence); it never writes status into it.

Design choices that follow the #44 final decision:

* **Presence-based normalization.** Ranking is driven by *breadth* — how many repos and
  languages exhibit an axis, and whether it generalizes from the dev split to held-out —
  NOT by raw occurrence count (which over-represents idioms frequent in one language or a
  large repo). Raw/weighted counts are reported but never drive the ranking.
* **dev = ranking/triage, held-out = generalization check.** A dev-only axis is marked as
  weaker evidence; an axis that also spreads to held-out is preferred.
* **Curated, not estimated.** ``implementation_cost`` / ``soundness_risk`` /
  ``substrate_required`` are a controlled vocabulary curated per axis (seeded from
  ``prioritize_frontier``'s reviewed constants) — never auto-estimated into fake numbers.
* **Stable existing artifacts.** ``prioritize_frontier.py`` and ``FRONTIER_PRIORITIES.md``
  are untouched; this tool emits its own ``frontier_platform.v1.json`` + markdown.

Outputs (``--json-out`` / ``--markdown-out``) describe the same data. The JSON records
reproducibility identity (corpus commit digest, candidate signature, tool version, build
ref, and — when the detector probe runs — the nose binary identity).
