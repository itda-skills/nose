# Type-4 coverage iteration log

This log records the first ten coverage-expansion iterations after the initial seed
benchmark. Each iteration adds one semantic proposal card to `proposals.v1.json`; the
generator then expands it across every supported language surface plus embedded script
surfaces.

## Baseline

Initial seed proposals:

- `sum_filter_positive`
- `count_filter_positive`
- `any_predicate_positive`

Baseline smoke:

```text
items: 99
positive recall: 38/66
hard-negative false merges: 0/33
```

## Iterations

| iteration | proposal | semantic class | hard-negative sibling |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `iter01_all_nonnegative` | `all(xs, x >= 0)` universal predicate | `x >= 0 -> x > 0` |
| 2 | `iter02_product_positive` | `product(filter(xs, x > 0), init=1)` | `init 1 -> 2` |
| 3 | `iter03_sum_even` | `sum(filter(xs, x % 2 == 0))` | `even -> odd` |
| 4 | `iter04_count_negative` | `count(filter(xs, x < 0))` | `x < 0 -> x <= 0` |
| 5 | `iter05_any_zero` | `any(xs, x == 0)` | `x == 0 -> x != 0` |
| 6 | `iter06_all_nonzero` | `all(xs, x != 0)` | `x != 0 -> x > 0` |
| 7 | `iter07_product_nonzero` | `product(filter(xs, x != 0), init=1)` | `x != 0 -> x > 0` |
| 8 | `iter08_sum_small` | `sum(filter(xs, x < 3))` | `x < 3 -> x <= 3` |
| 9 | `iter09_count_small` | `count(filter(xs, x < 3))` | `x < 3 -> x <= 3` |
| 10 | `iter10_any_even` | `any(xs, x % 2 == 0)` | `even -> odd` |

## Result after iteration 10

Default ring cross-surface generation:

```text
items: 429
positive recall: 156/286
hard-negative false merges: 0/143
```

Same-surface only:

```text
items: 286
positive recall: 54/143
hard-negative false merges: 0/143
```

Lowering smoke:

```text
files: 858
Raw nodes: 0 (0.000%)
```

Per-proposal recall with the default ring cross-surface set:

```text
any_predicate_positive: positive 14/22, false merges 0/11
count_filter_positive: positive 11/22, false merges 0/11
iter01_all_nonnegative: positive 14/22, false merges 0/11
iter02_product_positive: positive 10/22, false merges 0/11
iter03_sum_even: positive 11/22, false merges 0/11
iter04_count_negative: positive 11/22, false merges 0/11
iter05_any_zero: positive 14/22, false merges 0/11
iter06_all_nonzero: positive 14/22, false merges 0/11
iter07_product_nonzero: positive 10/22, false merges 0/11
iter08_sum_small: positive 11/22, false merges 0/11
iter09_count_small: positive 11/22, false merges 0/11
iter10_any_even: positive 14/22, false merges 0/11
sum_filter_positive: positive 11/22, false merges 0/11
```

The hard-negative result is the important safety signal: the new coverage increased the
frontier without introducing exact semantic false merges under the current evaluator. The
missed positives are under-merge work items for future normalization/value-graph iterations.

## Detector co-evolution loops

After the coverage-only expansion above, the benchmark was used as a detector-improvement
frontier. The starting point for the default ring cross-surface set was:

```text
items: 429
positive recall: 156/286
hard-negative false merges: 0/143
```

Ten detector/process co-evolution loops were then run. Loops 1-10 below are detector-facing
iterations against the generated semantic frontier; loops 11-17 close the original frontier
and harden the loop so later detector work cannot regress silently.

| loop | frontier target | detector change | recall after loop | false merges |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | filtered `reduce`/`fold` aggregate vs guarded loop | lower `filter(p).reduce(⊕, init)` to guarded `Reduce(⊕, init, p ? contrib : identity)` in the shared value graph | 186/286 | 0/143 |
| 2 | count-filter aggregate vs guarded count loop | lower `filter(p).length`, `filter(p).count()`, and `count { p }` to `Reduce(Add, 0, p ? 1 : 0)` | 207/286 | 0/143 |
| 3 | Java stream aggregate vs enhanced-for loop | recover single-parameter Java lambdas, peel `Arrays.stream(xs)` to `xs`, and canonicalize `anyMatch`/`allMatch` to `Any`/`All` | 220/286 | 0/143 |
| 4 | Ruby `select.reduce` vs guarded `each` loop | stop lowering Ruby `select` as a loop, canonicalize Ruby `select`/`collect` as `Filter`/`Map` HoF forms | 225/286 | 0/143 |
| 5 | Ruby `any?`/`all?` vs early-return loops | canonicalize Ruby predicate reductions and lower `return true/false` through Ruby argument lists | 235/286 | 0/143 |
| 6 | Rust early-return loops vs predicate reductions | process terminators nested under expression statements so Rust `return true;` participates in `Any`/`All` recognition | 250/286 | 0/143 |
| 7 | Python `math.prod` vs product loop | canonicalize `math.prod(iterable, start=...)` to multiplicative `Reduce` with filtered-map support | 252/286 | 0/143 |
| 8 | C pointer-length `for`/`while` aggregate forms | recognize `i < n` plus `xs[i]` as a bounded indexed loop while preserving non-contract bounds | 260/286 | 0/143 |
| 9 | C pointer-length loop vs other languages | introduce the explicit `(int *xs, int n)` full-length contract for strict `<` traversals | 276/286 | 0/143 |
| 10 | C `1/0` predicate reductions vs boolean languages | accept C `1/0` only inside guarded early-return `Any`/`All` recognition | 286/286 | 0/143 |

Same-surface only after these loops:

```text
items: 286
positive recall: 143/143
hard-negative false merges: 0/143
```

Lowering coverage after these loops:

```text
files: 858
Raw nodes: 0 (0.000%)
```

The original ring frontier is closed:

```text
default ring misses: 0/286 positives
same-surface misses: 0/143 positives
hard-negative false merges: 0/143
```

## Loop hardening after frontier closure

After the detector closed the original ring frontier, the loop was strengthened so the next
frontier expansion has better safety gates.

| loop | hardening target | change | smoke result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 11 | cross-language transitive coverage | run `--cross all` to verify every supported surface pair, not only the ring adjacency | 858/858 positives, 0/143 false merges |
| 12 | regression enforcement | add `frontier.py --fail-on-regression` and wire it into `scripts/type4-smoke.sh` when `BASELINE_JSON` is provided | no recall/false-merge regression against loop 10 |
| 13 | C contract adversaries | generate `c_start_one` and `c_stride_two` hard-negative siblings for every proposal | 286/286 positives, 0/169 false merges |
| 14 | evidence discipline | add `evidence.level` to the manifest schema and generator (`E1` positives, `E2` counterexample negatives) | generated manifests contain `E1,E2` |
| 15 | breadth-first complexity control | validate proposal fields and enforce `max_lines`/`max_branch_count` budgets during generation | 286/286 positives, 0/169 false merges |
| 16 | dense smoke with adversaries | run all-cross with the new C hard negatives and regression gate | 858/858 positives, 0/169 false merges |
| 17 | final documentation and gate | update docs and run the final release/test/docs smoke | 286/286 positives, 0/169 false merges |

Current default ring smoke after loop 16:

```text
items: 455
positive recall: 286/286
hard-negative false merges: 0/169
```

Current all-cross smoke after loop 16:

```text
items: 1027
positive recall: 858/858
hard-negative false merges: 0/169
```

This is the intended co-evolution shape: the synthetic factory exposed under-merge classes,
the detector gained concrete language/value-graph capabilities, and the hard negatives
remained clean. The next frontier should expand the semantic matrix rather than make these
same aggregate cases more complex; good next cells are selection reductions (`min`/`max`),
map/builders, zip/dot-product, string builders, and bounded recursion.

## Second detector/process expansion: loops 18-27

The next ten loops expanded the semantic matrix and used the generated misses to improve
the detector. This run added three new cells:

- selection reductions: clamped `min`/`max` folds with nearby `min`/`max` hard negatives;
- map-contribution reductions: `sum`/`product` over `x*x` contributions with `x*x -> x`
  hard negatives;
- aligned multi-collection reductions: dot product over `(a, b)` with `x*y -> x+y`
  hard negatives.

| loop | target | detector/process change | smoke result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 18 | selection reductions | add `iter11_max_seed_zero` and `iter12_min_seed_zero`; generator exposed 44 selection misses | 286/330 positives, 0/195 false merges |
| 19 | selection candidate reachability | add exact value-bucket candidate generation and selection-seed normalization for `Reduce` | 328/330 positives, 0/195 false merges |
| 20 | Rust fold selection | evaluate Rust expression-`if` branch blocks as values in the value graph | 330/330 positives, 0/195 false merges |
| 21 | map-contribution reductions | add `iter13_sum_positive_squares` and `iter14_product_nonzero_squares` | 374/374 positives, 0/221 false merges |
| 22 | map-contribution propagation | run dense `--cross all` for the expanded map-contribution set | 1122/1122 positives, 0/221 false merges |
| 23 | dot-product frontier | add `iter15_dot_product`; generator exposed Python zip, Go/Ruby enumerate, Rust zip-fold, and C shared-length misses | 386/396 positives, 0/234 false merges |
| 24 | dot-product detector fixes | preserve Go/Ruby index+value iteration via `Enumerate`, canonicalize Rust `.zip()` and tuple lambda params, support `Reduce` over zip element bindings, recognize Rust `0..a.len()`, and extend the C shared-length contract to `(a,b,n)` | 396/396 positives, 0/234 false merges |
| 25 | dot-product propagation | run dense `--cross all` for the dot-product set | 1188/1188 positives, 0/234 false merges |
| 26 | same-surface hard-negative gate | run `--cross none` to isolate per-surface positives plus all hard negatives | 198/198 positives, 0/234 false merges |
| 27 | final smoke/documentation gate | update the semantic scope/docs and run `scripts/type4-smoke.sh` on the release binary | 396/396 positives, 0/234 false merges |

Final current smoke numbers after loop 27:

```text
default ring: items 630, positives 396/396, false merges 0/234
same-surface: items 432, positives 198/198, false merges 0/234
all-cross: items 1422, positives 1188/1188, false merges 0/234
lowering coverage: 1260 files, 31042 IL nodes, Raw nodes 0 (0.000%)
```

The important detector changes were not language-isolated end states. Go range,
Ruby `each_with_index`, Rust iterator zip/fold, Python zip comprehensions, Java/JS indexed
loops, and C pointer-length loops now converge through the same shared value-graph shape:

```text
Reduce(Add, init=0, contrib=Elem(a) * Elem(b))
```

The hard-negative sibling `Elem(a) + Elem(b)` stayed separate across the generated corpus.

## Loop-quality strengthening: loops 28-32

After loop 27, the process was tightened to address the main critique: the previous
success could still be too generator-specific. These five loops strengthened the evaluation
loop before adding more semantic complexity.

| loop | target | change | result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 28 | split discipline and stronger hard negatives | mark cross-language positives and all negatives as `heldout`; add same-template and cross-template semantic hard negatives in addition to aggregate and C contract negatives | default ring: 396/396 positives, 0/630 false merges; heldout 198/198 positives, 0/630 false merges |
| 29 | dense language-pair heldout gate | run the stronger negative set with `--cross all` | all-cross: 1188/1188 positives, 0/1422 false merges; heldout 990/990 positives, 0/1422 false merges |
| 30 | unseen representation template | add heldout `indexed_loop` positives and `indexed-template-semantic-mutation` negatives for single-list specs | default ring: 583/583 positives, 0/817 false merges; heldout 385/385 positives, 0/817 false merges |
| 31 | negative taxonomy reporting | evaluator/frontier report false merges by `negative_tag` | all negative tags remained 0 false merges: aggregate, same-template, indexed-template, cross-template, C skipped-first, C stride-two |
| 32 | dense gate and docs | run current generator with `--cross none`, default ring, and `--cross all`; update docs/schema/logs | same-surface 385/385 and 0/619; default ring 583/583 and 0/817; all-cross 1375/1375 and 0/1609 |

No detector patch was needed in loops 28-32: the strengthened heldout templates and stronger
hard negatives did not expose a new under-merge or false merge. That is a useful signal, but
not a proof of breadth. It means the next semantic expansion should target a genuinely new
axis rather than another loop/reduction variant.

Operational finding: the default ring gate is still practical for routine loops, but the
strong all-cross gate grew to 2984 items and should be treated as a periodic dense gate, not
the inner-loop default.

## Coverage-preserving compaction and abs axis: loops 33-37

The next five loops addressed the scale problem directly, then added a new semantic axis.
The goal was to keep verification strict while reducing routine scan cost, and to ensure the
generator still forces detector changes when it exposes a real under-merge.

| loop | target | change | result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 33 | coverage-preserving compaction | add `select_cases.py` and `SUITE=core` smoke support; copy only selected source files into the compact suite | default ring compact: 125/1400 items, 18/18 positives, 0/107 false merges; full corpus remained 583/583 and 0/817 |
| 34 | new semantic axis | add `iter16_sum_abs_all`, covering sign-normalizing `sum(abs(x))` across every supported surface | first compact selector passed 19/19 and 0/113, but full ring exposed 13 misses, all in `iter16_sum_abs_all`; this showed the selector was too weak |
| 35 | detector and selector correction | generalize loop recurrence recognition from filtered reductions to full conditional contributions, strengthen `abs` pattern operand handling, and tune core selection to preserve proposal/representation/cross-surface coverage | compact ring: 365/1479 items, 153/153 positives, 0/212 false merges; full ring: 616/616 positives, 0/863 false merges |
| 36 | dense all-cross compact gate | run the new selector on `--cross all` to check all language-surface participation without scanning the whole dense corpus | all-cross compact: 359/3151 items, 151/151 positives, 0/208 false merges |
| 37 | smoke integration | run `scripts/type4-smoke.sh` with `SUITE=core CROSS=all`, including stats and frontier output | 359/3151 selected, 151/151 positives, 0/208 false merges; lowering coverage 718 files, 18446 IL nodes, Raw 0 (0.000%) |

Additional validation after loop 37:

- same-surface full (`--cross none`): 1061 items, 407/407 positives, 0/654 false merges;
- default ring full: 1479 items, 616/616 positives, 0/863 false merges;
- focused regression tests: `abs_idiom_converges` and
  `conditional_abs_reduction_converges_with_aggregate`.

Critical finding: compaction must preserve interactions, not just individual labels. A
proposal-level representative can miss a whole representation class; the first compact core
did not include the `loop -> aggregate` abs positives that failed in the full run. The
current selector deliberately keeps proposal-by-representation and proposal-by-cross-surface
features while still reducing dense all-cross evaluation from 3151 to 359 items.

## Strict semantic frontier expansion: loops 38-47

After the strict `semantic` mode contract was tightened, exact candidates are reported only
when every participating unit is `exact_safe`: no `Raw` nodes, no abstract-only literals,
and no opaque calls. The next ten loops widened that strict frontier without reintroducing
near-mode behavior into semantic mode.

Starting point after the strict gate:

```text
all-cross compact: 359/3151 selected, 143/151 positives, 0/208 false merges
misses: Rust range/adapter forms around dot-product and aggregate equivalents
```

| loop | frontier target | detector/frontend change | compact smoke result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 38 | strict-safe Rust range and modeled adapters | allow proved `Seq` range forms and a narrow set of modeled adapter calls (`iter`, `into_iter`, `collect`, `copied`, `cloned`, etc.) while keeping opaque calls unsafe | 151/151 positives, 0/208 false merges |
| 39 | regex literal predicates | retain JS regex source as `LitStr` and allow `.test(...)` only when the receiver is a literal regex/string; same pattern matches, different patterns do not | 151/151 positives, 0/208 false merges |
| 40 | sequence kind identity | key `Seq` value-graph nodes by sequence kind; distinguish Python list vs tuple and JS/Rust array-like forms | 151/151 positives, 0/208 false merges |
| 41 | JS object keys | lower JS object literals as key/value pairs; keep spread and methods as `Raw` so exact mode does not claim unproved object semantics | 151/151 positives, 0/208 false merges |
| 42 | Python dict keys | lower Python dict literals as key/value pairs; keep `**` unpacking as `Raw` until overwrite-order semantics are modeled | 151/151 positives, 0/208 false merges |
| 43 | Ruby hash keys | lower Ruby hash literals as key/value pairs; keep `**` hash splats as `Raw` | 151/151 positives, 0/208 false merges |
| 44 | JS static builtin guard | allow `Array.isArray(x)` only for receiver `Array` and method `isArray` | 151/151 positives, 0/208 false merges |
| 45 | JS `typeof` soundness | preserve `typeof x` as a strict-safe call and make `void`/`delete` raw instead of stripping them to the operand | 151/151 positives, 0/208 false merges |
| 46 | cross-language list-like literals | normalize list-like sequence tags (`array`, `list`, `array_expression`) while keeping tuple tags distinct | 151/151 positives, 0/208 false merges |
| 47 | cross-language map-like literals | normalize map-like tags (`object`, `dictionary`, `hash`) and normalize Ruby symbol/hash keys to their atom text | 151/151 positives, 0/208 false merges |

Focused strict-mode regressions added in these loops cover:

- same-regex positive vs different-regex negative;
- list vs tuple sequence identity;
- JS object, Python dict, and Ruby hash key preservation, including spread/splat negatives;
- exact `Array.isArray` and `typeof` guards;
- cross-language list-like and map-like literal convergence.

Real-repo check on `../craken-agents`:

```text
loop 39 semantic families: 17
loop 47 semantic families: 22
```

The five new families are attributable to the new strict frontier rather than near matching:

- `isRecord` / `isPlainObject` / `isWikiFrontMatter` style guards using
  `typeof value === 'object' && value !== null && !Array.isArray(value)`;
- `record` / `recordValue` object-or-null helpers;
- `isUnknownArray` / `isD1MigrationList` exact `Array.isArray` wrappers;
- `session` / `devUserSession` same-key object construction;
- `queueBatch` same-key object construction in production-error tests.

Final verification for loop 47:

```text
cargo test -p nose-cli --test cli          # 38 passed
cargo test -p nose-cli --test equivalence  # 100 passed
cargo test -p nose-detect                  # 19 passed
scripts/type4-smoke.sh SUITE=core CROSS=all # 151/151 positives, 0/208 false merges
```

Assessment: this was a real strict-frontier expansion, not just benchmark churn. The
aggregate/loop benchmark stayed closed while new exact semantic classes became reportable
on real code. The next frontier should add generated adversarial cases for these literal,
guard, and map/list axes so they are measured by `type4-smoke.sh`, not only by focused CLI
tests and repo dogfooding.

## Free-binding and call-identity loops: loops 48-52

The previous real-repo review found two opposed problems:

- soundness gap: functions that reference same-named module constants could merge even when
  the module constants differed (`date-fns` locale tables);
- recall gap: useful JavaScript helper/assertion clones disappeared because strict mode
  rejected every uninterpreted call (`execa` test helpers).

These five loops addressed those two axes, with a deliberate rollback of an over-broad
call opening.

| loop | target | change | result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 48 | free module binding soundness | seed the value graph with strict-safe top-level literal/sequence/map assignments, keyed by the original binding name, so free references inside functions evaluate to the captured value instead of `Input(name)` | focused module-constant regression passed |
| 49 | module capture safety | restrict captured globals to literal/sequence/map/index/bin/unop expressions; top-level calls, lambdas, functions, loops, raw nodes, and splats remain uncaptured | `date-fns` large locale-table merge split by actual table values |
| 50 | safe uninterpreted JS calls | allow JavaScript free-function calls when the callee identity and exact-safe arguments are preserved | recovered useful `execa` helper clones |
| 51 | receiver method identity | allow JavaScript method calls with explicit receiver value and method name, still relying on the pre-walk to reject raw/spread/unsafe arguments | recovered assertion-helper clones such as `t.is(...)` |
| 52 | over-broad call rollback | an experiment that allowed generic uninterpreted calls for every language exploded the 8-repo sample (`go` 8→87, `java` 13→95, `c` 13→87); the gate was narrowed back to JavaScript-only | compact smoke remained 151/151 positives, 0/208 false merges |

Language-sample comparison after loop 52, using the same fixed sample as the prior review
and excluding `retrofit/website/public/**` generated docs:

| language | repo | installed semantic families | strict loop 47 | loop 52 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Python | `marshmallow` | 39 | 8 | 8 |
| JavaScript | `execa` | 15 | 0 | 3 |
| TypeScript | `date-fns` | 61 | 18 | 19 |
| Go | `etcd` | 86 | 8 | 8 |
| Rust | `alacritty` | 19 | 5 | 5 |
| Java | `retrofit` | 154 | 13 | 13 |
| C | `libsodium` | 120 | 13 | 13 |
| Ruby | `thor` | 6 | 1 | 1 |

Qualitative findings:

- `execa`: recovered 3 useful JavaScript test-helper families, e.g.
  `testNoPrintCompletion`/`testNoPrintCommand`, `testScriptStdoutSync`/`testScriptStdout`,
  and generator helpers.
- `date-fns`: the previous broad locale `formatRelative` merge no longer groups unrelated
  locale tables. The main 58-member family split into smaller same-table/same-behavior
  groups; total member count dropped from 116 to 63 despite family count increasing by one.
- Other languages stayed at the loop-47 strict level after the call rollback, avoiding the
  installed-version flood of call-heavy test/framework clones.
- `craken-agents`: remained stable at 22 strict semantic families, byte-for-byte same
  family keys as loop 47.

Final verification for loop 52:

```text
cargo test -p nose-cli --test cli          # 41 passed
cargo test -p nose-cli --test equivalence  # 100 passed
cargo test -p nose-detect                  # 19 passed
scripts/type4-smoke.sh SUITE=core CROSS=all # 151/151 positives, 0/208 false merges
```

Assessment: module-constant capture is a clear strict-soundness improvement and should be
kept. JavaScript-only uninterpreted call identity is useful but still a provisional
frontier: it recovers real helper clones without widening other languages. General
cross-language call identity should not be reopened until imports/bindings are modeled
explicitly enough to prove that two same-named callees are the same function.

## Generic proof facts and semantic-axis smoke: loop 53

Loop 52 intentionally left a language-specific JS call gate. Loop 53 replaces that with a
language-neutral proof-fact model:

- strict safety now uses file-level `StrictFacts`, not `Lang::JavaScript`;
- free `Name` values are exact-safe only when proven by a single-assignment immutable
  binding or a safe same-file function binding;
- repeated top-level assignments are not captured as immutable values;
- proven helper callees are keyed by a literal-sensitive function-binding hash, so
  `helper(x + 1)` and `helper(x + 2)` do not collapse;
- method calls are allowed generically when receiver identity and method name are proven;
- unproven free globals remain `expected_exact_detect=false` unsafe-boundary cases.

The generator now records `semantic_axes` and capability states in every manifest item and
adds breadth-first axis cases for:

- `immutable_binding`;
- `proven_callee_identity`;
- `table_access`;
- `unsafe_boundary`.

The compact selector now preserves semantic-axis and capability-state coverage, not only
proposal/representation/cross-surface coverage. A capability matrix lives in
`capabilities.v1.json`; import/re-export identity and table access for several compiled
language surfaces remain explicit unsupported/partial cells instead of hidden TODOs.

Focused axis validation after the detector change:

```text
SUITE=core CROSS=none compact axis check:
items: 200
positive recall: 66/66
hard-negative false merges: 0/134

by semantic axis:
  aggregate_reduction: positive 37/37, false merges 0/94
  immutable_binding: positive 11/11, false merges 0/11
  proven_callee_identity: positive 11/11, false merges 0/11
  table_access: positive 7/7, false merges 0/7
  unsafe_boundary: positive 0/0, false merges 0/11
```

Final dense compact smoke:

```text
scripts/type4-smoke.sh SUITE=core CROSS=all
selected items: 428/3220
positive recall: 180/180
hard-negative false merges: 0/248
Raw nodes: 0/20684
```

Assessment: this is the intended direction. A rule learned from JavaScript helper clones is
now represented as a common proof obligation, and the generator can exercise it across all
surfaces that currently emit the necessary facts. The next frontier is structured import
facts: same import coordinate should become proven callee identity, while wildcard imports,
re-exports, dynamic import, and unresolved aliases should remain unsafe-boundary cases.

## Adversarial import-identity coevolution: loops 54-63

This run followed the stricter coevolution protocol: generator first, current detector
measurement second, detector change only when a real frontier failure appeared, then an
immediate generator counterattack.

| loop | generator move | current-detector result | detector / loop change | result |

Real-repo audit (`../craken-agents`) added six strict semantic families and removed none.
Examples of added families:

- `fileBrowserTargetHref` / `fileTargetHref`;
- `interactionCheckResult` / `visualCheckResult`;
- `agentTokenUsageCommand` / `readMessagePageFromStoreCommand`;
- `agentEffectSink` fixtures;
- `conversationKindBinding` helpers;
- `queueBatch` fixtures.

Assessment: this run matched the adversarial coevolution shape better than earlier loops.
The generator found a real under-merge first, the detector fix was a common proof-fact
extension rather than a language-name exception, and the counterattack found a second real
miss in multi-specifier imports. Unsupported forms remain explicit unsafe-boundary cases
instead of being silently accepted.

## Adversarial projection-identity coevolution: loops 64-73

This run widened the strict frontier from import coordinates to static field/property
projection coordinates. The rule is intentionally narrow: a frontend may emit ordinary
`Field(base, key)` evidence only when both the receiver expression and projected key are
static in the source form. Dynamic keys and destructuring defaults remain outside strict
exact reporting unless a future proof establishes the missing facts.

| loop | generator move | current-detector result | detector / loop change | result |
|---|---|---:|---|---:|
| 64 | add `projection_identity` capability axis with temp, destructuring, and static-key cases | projection positives 7/11, false merges 0/11 | no detector change yet; this established the frontier | JS-family destructuring, Rust destructuring, and JS static string-key misses recorded |
| 65 | focus static string-key projection | `row['today']` did not converge with `row.today` | lower JS/TS static string subscript keys to the same `Field(base, key)` coordinate as dotted access | static-key positive 1/1 |
| 66 | focus destructuring projection | object/struct patterns were not binding selected fields as values | lower JS object destructuring and Rust aliased struct patterns to projection assignments | destructuring positives closed in compact smoke |
| 67 | add shorthand/multi destructuring plus default/dynamic-key hard negatives | compact smoke passed, but selection only sampled part of the new projection surface | add full-manifest evaluation as a countercheck for newly widened axes | compact projection 11/11, false merges 0/12 |
| 68 | full-manifest countercheck | Rust shorthand struct destructuring missed outside compact selection | add conservative Rust struct-pattern text fallback for simple shorthand/alias fields | full projection 34/34, false merges 0/44 |
| 69 | default destructuring boundary | no false merge | reject JS alias defaults as projection evidence; defaults need a field-presence proof | 0/5 false merges |
| 70 | dynamic-key boundary | no false merge | no detector change; dynamic keys remain unproven projection bindings | 0/5 false merges |
| 71 | focused CLI regression | synthetic smoke covered the behavior, but unit gate needed a smaller check | add `scan_mode_semantic_allows_static_projection_identity` for JS key/destructure and Rust shorthand | CLI test passed |
| 72 | dense all-cross validation | full compact smoke needed to ensure aggregate/import/table frontiers stayed closed | no detector change | 471/3392 selected, 200/200 positives, 0/271 false merges |
| 73 | real repo audit on `../craken-agents` | strict semantic families 32→32 | no detector change; this repo did not expose new projection-result families | 0 added, 0 removed |

Final full same-surface manifest check for the projection counterattack:

```text
items: 1302
positive recall: 509/509
hard-negative false merges: 0/793

by semantic axis:
  projection_identity: positive 34/34, false merges 0/44
```

```

Real-repo audit (`../craken-agents`) did not change the visible strict semantic family
set: 32 before, 32 after, with no added or removed families. Assessment: the synthetic
frontier expanded in a strict and useful way, but this particular repo does not yet
validate projection identity as a high-yield real-world source of new refactoring
candidates. The loop itself did improve: compact smoke missed one Rust shorthand case, so
full-manifest evaluation should be used as a periodic adversarial countercheck whenever a
new semantic axis is introduced or substantially widened.

## Adversarial nullish-default coevolution: loops 74-83

This run targeted a soundness-critical JavaScript-family frontier. Before this loop, `??`
was lowered to the same value-`Or` operator as `||`. That recovered some superficial
similarity, but it was not strict Type-4: `value ?? fallback` differs from
`value || fallback` for falsy non-null values such as `0`.

| loop | generator move | current-detector result | detector / loop change | result |
|---|---|---:|---|---:|
| 74 | add `nullish_default` capability axis with `??`, explicit `== null` ternary, guard return, and truthy-or boundary | nullish positives 0/5, false merges 3/5 | no detector change yet; this established both under-merge and over-merge failures | failure recorded |
| 75 | focus `??` vs explicit nullish ternary | coalesce positives missed | lower JS/TS `??` to `If(value == null, fallback, value)` instead of `Or(value, fallback)` | coalesce positives 4/4 in compact smoke |
| 76 | focus guard-return equivalence | guard positive now converged through existing guarded-return/Phi machinery | no value-graph change needed | guard positive 1/1 |
| 77 | truthy-or counterattack | previous false merges disappeared after loop 75 | no detector change; `||` remains value-or, distinct from nullish default | truthy boundary 0/3 false merges |
| 78 | generator audit | an automatic hard-negative for guard identity was accidentally identical to the positive | mutate the guard fallback in negative variants | generator bug fixed |
| 79 | focused CLI regression | synthetic smoke covered it, but a smaller invariant was needed | add `scan_mode_semantic_distinguishes_nullish_from_truthy_defaults` | CLI test passed |
| 80 | full same-surface manifest | compact selector was not enough for a new soundness axis | no detector change | 519/519 positives, 0/808 false merges |
| 81 | dense all-cross validation | aggregate/import/projection frontiers stayed closed | no detector change | 481/3417 selected, 205/205 positives, 0/276 false merges |
| 82 | real repo audit on `../craken-agents` | strict semantic families 32→32 | no detector change; this repo did not expose new nullish-result families | 0 added, 0 removed |
| 83 | process assessment | this loop found a real over-merge, not only missed positives | keep truthy-vs-nullish hard negatives as a standing soundness gate | gate retained |

Final full same-surface manifest check:

```text
items: 1327
positive recall: 519/519
hard-negative false merges: 0/808

by semantic axis:
  nullish_default: positive 10/10, false merges 0/15
```

```

Real-repo audit (`../craken-agents`) again left the visible strict semantic family set
unchanged: 32 before, 32 after. Assessment: this was still a worthwhile frontier expansion
because it closed a strict-mode soundness bug (`??` vs `||`) and added an adversarial
boundary that should prevent future regressions.

## Adversarial record-shape-guard coevolution: loops 84-93

This run targeted a narrow but common JavaScript-family proof obligation: a value is a
plain record only when the source proves all three facts at once:

- `typeof value === "object"`;
- `value` is not null, either by explicit null comparison or a conservative truthy check;
- `!Array.isArray(value)`.

The detector must not treat partial object checks as exact Type-4 clones of full
record-shape guards.

| loop | generator move | current-detector result | detector / loop change | result |
|---|---|---:|---|---:|
| 84 | add `record_shape_guard` capability axis with clause-order and truthy-null-check positives plus missing-null/missing-array boundaries | record positives 0/5, false merges 0/5 | no detector change yet; this established the under-merge frontier | failure recorded |
| 85 | focus reordered three-clause guard | equivalent guards lowered as ordinary boolean chains | add conservative JS/TS recognition for exactly three same-identifier clauses and emit `record_guard` | single-case IL converged |
| 86 | exact-value size counterattack | `record_guard(value)` was too small for the strict value-family floor | include fact literals (`object`, `non_null`, `not_array`) and mark `record_guard` strict-safe in the value graph | single-case scan reported the family |
| 87 | generator hard-negative audit | three reported false merges were caused by generated negatives that were accidentally equivalent | mutate identity-proposal negatives to an unrelated property predicate | focused compact: 96/96 positives, 0/167 false merges |
| 88 | focused CLI regression | synthetic smoke covered it, but a smaller invariant was needed | add `scan_mode_semantic_proves_js_record_shape_guards` with missing-null and missing-array negatives | CLI test passed |
| 89 | full same-surface manifest | compact selector was not enough for a new proof axis | no detector change | 529/529 positives, 0/828 false merges |
| 90 | dense all-cross validation | aggregate/import/projection/nullish frontiers stayed closed | no detector change | 491/3447 selected, 210/210 positives, 0/281 false merges |
| 91 | default ring validation | full ring corpus needed current README numbers | no detector change | 1775 items, 738/738 positives, 0/1037 false merges |
| 92 | real repo audit on `../craken-agents` | strict semantic families 32→32 | no detector change; this repo already had same-form `isRecord` helpers but no newly exposed reordered/truthy variants | 0 added, 0 removed |
| 93 | process assessment | synthetic frontier expanded but real-repo family yield was neutral | keep full-manifest counterchecks for new proof axes and mine real corpora for the next guard-family variants | gate retained |

Final full same-surface manifest check:

```text
items: 1357
positive recall: 529/529
hard-negative false merges: 0/828

  record_shape_guard: positive 10/10, false merges 0/20

```

Real-repo audit (`../craken-agents`) left the visible strict semantic family set unchanged:
32 before, 32 after. The current result already contains a useful seven-member
`isRecord`/`isPlainObject` family, so this loop did not create a new refactoring candidate
there. Assessment: this was still a strict-frontier expansion because reordered full
guards and conservative truthy-null checks now converge, while missing-null, missing-array,
and property-predicate siblings remain outside exact semantic mode. The next similar loop
should start from real-corpus guard variants, especially property-presence and typed-field
checks, before adding another synthetic guard axis.

## Real-corpus-guided own-property-guard coevolution: loops 94-103

This run followed the real-corpus-guided variant of the loop. Before adding a new synthetic
axis, the 105 pinned benchmark repos were mined for JavaScript-family guard idioms:

```text
quoted `key in obj`: 599 matches in 21 repos
typeof property === function: 425 matches in 13 repos
direct .hasOwnProperty(...): 224 matches in 11 repos
typeof property === string: 199 matches in 12 repos
Object.hasOwn(...): 116 matches in 6 repos
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(...): 109 matches in 11 repos
```

The chosen strict frontier was `own_property_guard`: `Object.hasOwn(obj, key)` and
`Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, key)` prove the same own-property presence check
when the receiver and key coordinates are fixed. The prototype-including `key in obj`,
shadowable direct `obj.hasOwnProperty(key)`, locally shadowed `Object`, and different
static keys remain hard boundaries.

| loop | generator move | current-detector result | detector / loop change | result |
|---|---|---:|---|---:|
| 94 | mine guard idioms in the 105 pinned benchmark repos | `Object.hasOwn` and `hasOwnProperty.call` were both frequent enough to justify an axis | choose `own_property_guard` instead of inventing an arbitrary synthetic-only guard | frontier selected |
| 95 | add `own_property_guard` capability axis with `Object.hasOwn` vs `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call`, `in`, direct-method, shadowed-`Object`, and different-key siblings | own-property positives 0/5, false merges 0/5 | no detector change yet; this established the under-merge frontier | failure recorded |
| 96 | focus static own-property call identity | two equivalent builtins lowered as unrelated calls | lower both call forms to `own_property_guard(receiver, key, own, present)` | focused compact closed |
| 97 | hard-negative counterattack | `in`, direct method, shadowed `Object`, and different-key siblings stayed separate | reject `Object.hasOwn` special lowering when `Object` is locally bound before the call | 0/5 false merges |
| 98 | focused CLI regression | synthetic smoke covered it, but a smaller invariant was needed | add `scan_mode_semantic_proves_js_own_property_guards` with direct/in/different-key/shadowed-Object negatives | CLI test passed |
| 99 | full same-surface manifest | compact selector was not enough for a new proof axis | no detector change | 534/534 positives, 0/848 false merges |
| 100 | dense all-cross validation | aggregate/import/projection/nullish/record frontiers stayed closed | no detector change | 501/3472 selected, 215/215 positives, 0/286 false merges |
| 101 | default ring validation | README current smoke numbers needed a full ring run | no detector change | 1800 items, 743/743 positives, 0/1057 false merges |
| 102 | real repo audit on `../craken-agents`, `axios`, and `drizzle-orm` | visible strict semantic family counts unchanged | no detector change; these repos did not contain same-key mixed-form families that surfaced as new refactoring candidates | 0 added, 0 removed |
| 103 | process assessment plus prioritizer | real-corpus mining improved axis choice, but visible refactoring yield was neutral and recent loops were JS-family heavy | add `prioritize_frontier.py` and require the next ordinary frontier to be all-language or multi-language | next target: `collection_empty_check` |

Final full same-surface manifest check:

```text
items: 1382
positive recall: 534/534
hard-negative false merges: 0/848

by semantic axis:
  own_property_guard: positive 5/5, false merges 0/20
```

Final dense compact smoke:

```text
scripts/type4-smoke.sh SUITE=core CROSS=all
selected items: 501/3472
positive recall: 215/215
hard-negative false merges: 0/286

```

Real-repo audits were neutral:

```text
../craken-agents: 32 -> 32, added 0, removed 0
bench/repos/axios: 7 -> 7, added 0, removed 0
bench/repos/drizzle-orm: 56 -> 56, added 0, removed 0
```

Assessment: this loop did widen the strict frontier from real-code evidence, not from
synthetic convenience. It is a modest detector improvement because the exact semantic
channel now understands a common own-property idiom pair and preserves the important
prototype/shadowing boundaries. The next loop should probably target property type guards
only after a broader axis. The newly added prioritizer ranks `collection_empty_check` first:
49,377 matches across 92 repos and seven languages, with low estimated implementation cost
and moderate soundness risk. That should be the next ordinary frontier.

## Pattern-guided collection-empty coevolution: loops 104-110

This run used the repo-wide pattern prioritizer instead of choosing a hand-picked language
feature. The selected all-language axis was `collection_empty_check`: zero-length
comparisons and named empty/non-empty predicates should converge only when the receiver
coordinate and threshold are fixed.

| loop | generator / audit move | current-detector result | detector / loop change | result |
|---|---|---:|---|---:|
| 104 | use pattern-frequency prioritization across the 105 pinned repos | `collection_empty_check` ranked first: 21,562 raw / 18,145 weighted hits across 98 repos and 8 languages | choose it as the next ordinary frontier and keep the broad-probe gap as diagnostic-only evidence | frontier selected |
| 105 | add same-surface positives for `len/length/size == 0` vs named empty predicates, plus nonzero-threshold and wrong-receiver hard negatives | release detector hit 16/22 collection positives and 0/44 false merges | misses were Rust `.is_empty()`, Java `.isEmpty()`, and Ruby `.empty?` named forms | failure recorded |
| 106 | focus named empty/non-empty predicates | named forms did not share the length-zero proof fact | add `Builtin::IsEmpty`, lower Rust/Java/Ruby named predicates, and canonicalize `Len(x) == 0` / `Len(x) != 0` in the value graph | focused collection check 22/22, 0/44 false merges |
| 107 | full same-surface countercheck | all previous axes needed a regression check after adding a new builtin | no extra detector change | 1,448 items, 556/556 positives, 0/892 false merges |
| 108 | real-repo delta audit on Rust/Ruby/Java repos | fastlane exposed a misleading long-span family after else-after-return flattening: a large `if/else` was reported as the guard-only value | shrink the flattened guard `if` span to condition+then branch and add `scan_mode_semantic_reports_flattened_guard_span_only` | the candidate became a short guard-clause family, not a whole-branch refactor |
| 109 | dense compact all-cross validation | old axes and the new collection axis needed a combined smoke | no extra detector change | 523/3,538 selected, 226/226 positives, 0/297 false merges, Raw 0/22,976 |
| 110 | default ring validation and priority refresh | collection frontier was closed but still ranked first until status changed | mark `collection_empty_check` as `covered-current` in the prioritizer | 1,866 items, 765/765 positives, 0/1,101 false merges; next recommended axis: `string_prefix_suffix` |

Real-repo delta audits:

bench/repos/alacritty: 14 -> 11 families, added 2, removed 5
bench/repos/fastlane: 89 -> 90 families, added 10, removed 9
bench/repos/jsoup: 58 -> 59 families, added 4, removed 3
```

Assessment: the quantitative pattern loop was useful, but only because it included a
real-delta audit. Synthetic hard negatives proved the strict collection axis, while the
real audit found a reporting/span bug that synthetic collection cases alone would not have
caught. This suggests the right cadence for future axes: run one complete pattern loop
per semantic axis, then repeat three to five times only while the prioritizer still
surfaces uncovered high-yield axes or real-delta audits reveal strict families that the
synthetic generator does not yet model.

## Pattern-filtered string prefix/suffix coevolution: loops 111-118

This run repeated the quantitative loop, but tightened the interpretation of extraction
gaps. Broad-probe hits are now split into true uncovered gaps and filtered overreach, so
the loop does not inflate strict Type-4 coverage by absorbing non-strict patterns.

The selected all-language axis was `string_prefix_suffix`: case-sensitive starts-with and
ends-with predicates should converge when receiver, direction, and literal affix are fixed,
and must not merge different affixes, opposite direction, or wrong receivers.

| loop | generator / audit move | current-detector result | detector / loop change | result |
|---|---|---:|---|---:|
| 111 | repeat repo-wide pattern prioritization after collection closure | `string_prefix_suffix` ranked first among open axes: 6,174 raw hits across 97 repos and 7 languages | choose it as the next ordinary frontier | frontier selected |
| 112 | add same-surface and ring cross-surface prefix/suffix positives plus affix, direction, and receiver hard negatives | release detector hit 24/40 focused positives and 0/100 false merges | misses were Go static `strings.HasPrefix/HasSuffix` and cross-language API-name convergence | failure recorded |
| 113 | focus prefix/suffix proof facts | method names did not share a cross-language proof coordinate | add `Builtin::StartsWith` and `Builtin::EndsWith`, lower Go/Java/JS/Python/Ruby/Rust/TS forms, and preserve builtin identity in the value graph | focused check 40/40 positives, 0/100 false merges |
| 114 | focused CLI regression | synthetic smoke covered it, but CLI semantic mode needed a small guard | add `scan_mode_semantic_proves_string_prefix_checks` with affix/direction/receiver negatives | CLI test passed |
| 115 | repeat pattern-gap audit | two apparent gaps were not true strict candidates | filter Python `for ... in ...` iteration from membership probes and compound `len(a)+len(b)-len(c)>0` arithmetic from collection-empty probes | membership raw 25,776→22,979 with 2,798 filtered; collection gap 1→0 with 1 filtered |
| 116 | full-manifest evaluator cost audit | full ring scan was fast, but manifest matching took more than 4 minutes | index family locations by file before checking left/right overlaps | full ring evaluation became practical without changing detector behavior |
| 117 | full and dense validation | old axes and the new prefix/suffix axis needed combined smoke | no extra detector change | full ring: 2,006 items, 805/805 positives, 0/1,201 false merges; dense compact all-cross: 578/3,923 selected, 246/246 positives, 0/332 false merges |
| 118 | real-repo delta audit on Rust/Java/JS repos | visible family set was unchanged | no detector change; this axis mostly adds primitive proof facts rather than immediate refactoring-visible families | alacritty 1→1 / 11→11 low-floor, antlr4 62→62 / 241→241, axios 7→7 / 33→33 |

string_prefix_suffix: covered-current, score 7.20, 6,174 raw hits, 0 gaps
```

Assessment: this loop did expand the strict semantic frontier, but the real-repo audit did
not yet show new refactoring-visible families. That is acceptable for this axis because
prefix/suffix checks are usually small proof facts that make larger future equivalences
possible. The more important process improvement was the filtered-probe accounting: repeat
the quantitative pattern loop, but only promote gaps that remain strict after overreach
filtering. The next ordinary open axis should likely be `membership_contains`, with a
careful first split between substring contains, list/set membership, map-key membership,
and Python iteration syntax.

## Loop acceleration: loops 119-122

Before widening the next semantic frontier, the loop machinery was made cheaper without
adding a new orchestration script.

| loop | bottleneck | change | measured result |
|---|---|---|---:|
| 119 | generator always emitted every semantic class | add `generate.py --axis` and `--proposal-prefix` filters | `string_prefix_suffix` focused corpus: 70 items instead of 2,006 ring items |
| 120 | smoke gate had only full/compact knobs | add `GATE=focused|core|full` to `scripts/type4-smoke.sh`, passing focused filters through to the generator | `GATE=focused AXIS=string_prefix_suffix`: 20/20 positives, 0/50 false merges, Raw 0/1,512 |
| 121 | prioritizer rescanned 59k files on every rerun | add input-fingerprint cache to `prioritize_frontier.py` | cached rerun: about 1.8s after a 61.8s cold run |
| 122 | real-repo audit target selection was manual | report top matching repos per frontier candidate | `membership_contains` audit starts from `guava`, `sympy`, and `sqlalchemy` rather than arbitrary repos |

The next detector loop should use `GATE=focused` for the new strict sub-axis, `GATE=core`
after the first detector fix, and full/dense validation only when the focused frontier is
closed.

## Literal collection membership: loops 123-129

The next `membership_contains` split deliberately avoided the overloaded broad contains
space. The closed sub-axis is only static literal collection membership: an element
coordinate checked against a fixed literal collection. Substring contains, map-key
membership, dynamic set membership, and arbitrary receiver `.contains()` remain outside
this proof fact.

| loop | pressure | change | measured result |
|---|---|---|---:|
| 123 | `membership_contains` was too broad to open soundly | select `literal_collection_membership` as a strict sub-axis and mark Java/C unsupported for this first slice | focused manifest generated 90 items: 18 positives, 72 negatives |
| 124 | existing detector did not converge literal membership APIs | baseline `target/release/nose` missed all focused positives | 0/18 positives, 0/72 false merges |

map_default_lookup: open, score 31.23, 4,319 raw hits, 0 gaps
```

Assessment: this loop expanded the strict semantic frontier and improved the adversarial
process. It did not add visible refactoring candidates in the top membership-heavy repos,
which is acceptable for this narrow proof fact: literal membership is often a small
predicate, and the first real value is reducing future ambiguity around membership/contains.
The next cost-effective ordinary open axis is now `map_default_lookup`; remaining
membership work should target map-key and dynamic set membership only when receiver/key
coordinates are provable.

## Literal map-default lookup: loops 130-136

The next `map_default_lookup` split was narrowed to literal Python/Ruby maps first. This
captures the highest-confidence dynamic-language part of the candidate without claiming
typed map semantics for Go/Java/Rust or JS/TS object/Map missing-key behavior.

| loop | pressure | change | measured result |
|---|---|---|---:|
| 130 | broad map-default APIs mix absent-key, typed-map, and mutation semantics | choose `literal_map_default_lookup`: static literal map, dynamic key, literal fallback | focused manifest generated 20 items: 4 positives, 16 negatives |
| 131 | existing detector had no common map-default coordinate | baseline `target/release/nose` missed all focused positives | 0/4 positives, 0/16 false merges |
| 132 | Python `.get` and Ruby `.fetch` needed one strict coordinate | add `Builtin::GetOrDefault`, lower only literal-map receivers, and normalize the map argument inside this builtin | CLI map-default test passed |

property_type_guard: open, score 5.01, 435 raw hits, 0 gaps
```

Assessment: this loop again widened the strict frontier without adding visible real-repo
families. The strict slice is intentionally small but useful: it prevents a future
map-default implementation from conflating key, fallback, or literal map differences.
The next open frontier is `property_type_guard`; however, broader partially-covered axes
(`numeric_minmax_abs`, `null_option_presence`, and the remaining membership/map slices)
may still be better if the next loop targets breadth rather than a new narrow JS-family
axis.

## Null/option presence predicates: loops 137-144

The next loop chose a broader `null_option_presence` slice instead of the narrower
JS-family `property_type_guard`. Existing comparison forms already converged in many
languages, but method-form absence/presence predicates were not a common proof fact:
Ruby `nil?`, Rust `is_none`/`is_some`, C `NULL`, and Rust `None` needed to meet the same
strict value coordinate as explicit null comparisons.

| loop | pressure | change | measured result |
|---|---|---|---:|
| 137 | avoid narrow JS-only work | choose `null_presence_predicate`: explicit null comparison plus method-form absence/presence direction | focused manifest generated 88 items: 22 positives, 66 negatives |
| 138 | validate real algorithm delta | baseline `target/release/nose` before this loop had partial recall but no false merges | 17/22 positives, 0/66 false merges |
| 139 | generator adversary check | fix identity semantic-mutation negatives so they actually flip to non-null direction | baseline stayed 17/22, 0/66 |
| 140 | detector/frontend strengthening | add `Builtin::IsNull`/`IsNotNull`, lower Ruby `nil?` and Rust `is_none`/`is_some`, map C `NULL` and Rust `None` to null literals | CLI null-presence test passed |
| 141 | focused gate | compare explicit null checks, method forms, non-null direction, and wrong-value boundaries | focused: 22/22 positives, 0/66 false merges |
| 142 | compact core gate | run coverage-preserving core on the focused axis | selected 48/88; 19/19 positives, 0/29 false merges |
| 143 | aggregate regression gate | run ring, same-surface, and dense all-cross compact gates | ring 849/849 and 0/1,355; same-surface 598/598 and 0/1,019; dense compact 280/280 and 0/398 |
| 144 | reprioritize frontier | update `null_option_presence` as partially covered: presence predicates covered, richer option unwrap/default and pointer aliases remain | next open axis still `property_type_guard`; broad high-yield axes remain `numeric_minmax_abs` and remaining null/option slices |

Final focused null-presence gate:

```text
items: 88
positive recall: 22/22
hard-negative false merges: 0/66
```

Final default ring smoke:

```text
items: 2204
positive recall: 849/849
hard-negative false merges: 0/1355

  null_presence_predicate: positive 22/22, false merges 0/66
```

Final dense all-cross compact smoke:

```text

selected items: 678/4427
positive recall: 280/280
hard-negative false merges: 0/398
Raw nodes: 0/26487
```

Assessment: this loop is a better fit for the co-evolution goal than a narrow
`property_type_guard` loop. It improved the detector on a broadly meaningful semantic
axis, added adversarial hard negatives for direction and value-coordinate mistakes, and
kept the full corpus false-merge count at zero. The remaining weakness is that this still
does not model richer option operations such as unwrap/default, nor pointer alias facts.

## Loop preflight hardening: loop 145

Immediately after the null-presence loop, `property_type_guard` was tested as the next
open candidate. A focused corpus could be generated, but the baseline already detected all
strict positives after the generator mutation bug was fixed:

```text
items: 37
positive recall: 5/5
hard-negative false merges: 0/32
```

That made the candidate a benchmark-only expansion rather than a detector-improvement
loop, so the implementation was discarded. To prevent repeating that waste, the loop now
has an explicit preflight:

```text
python3 bench/type4/preflight_axis.py --axis <axis> --out-dir /tmp/nose-type4-preflight
```

The preflight generates a focused corpus and evaluates baseline and candidate binaries. It
fails if the candidate has false merges, if the baseline has no positive misses and no
false merges, or if the candidate does not reduce either misses or baseline false merges.
Running it against the already-covered `null_presence_predicate` correctly fails with:

```text
baseline: items=88 positive=22/22 misses=0 false_merges=0/66
candidate: items=88 positive=22/22 misses=0 false_merges=0/66
preflight failed: baseline already covers all strict positives
```

## Rust option-pattern presence: loops 146-152

The next null/option slice attacked a Rust-specific gap inside the broader
`null_presence_predicate` axis: `if let Some(_) = value { true } else { false }` should be
the same strict presence predicate as `value.is_some()`, while `if let None` and checks on
another option value must stay outside the family.

| loop | pressure | change | measured result |
|---|---|---|---:|
| 146 | generator adversary | add Rust `if let Some(_)` identity, `if let None` boundary, and wrong-value boundary proposals under `null_presence_predicate` | focused manifest generated 4 items: 1 positive, 3 negatives |
| 147 | baseline measurement | pre-loop release did not understand the pattern condition and also over-merged two hard negatives | baseline: 0/1 positives, 2/3 false merges |
| 148 | preflight policy | treat removal of baseline false merges as a valid detector-improvement loop, while still requiring candidate false merges to be zero | candidate preflight: 1/1 positives, 0/3 false merges |
| 149 | Rust frontend strengthening | lower `let Some`/`let None` conditions to `IsNotNull`/`IsNull`, and return tail expression statements without semicolons | CLI and equivalence regressions passed |
| 150 | value-graph strengthening | canonicalize `Phi(cond, true, false)` to `cond` and `Phi(cond, false, true)` to `Not(cond)` | `if let Some(_)` converges with `is_some()` and stays distinct from `if let None` |
| 151 | focused/core gates | run focused proposal and null-presence core gates | focused: 1/1 and 0/3; null core selected 49/92, 18/18 and 0/31 |
| 152 | aggregate validation | run default ring, same-surface, and dense all-cross compact gates | ring 850/850 and 0/1,358; same-surface 599/599 and 0/1,022; dense compact 280/280 and 0/400 |

Final focused if-let gate:

```text
items: 4
positive recall: 1/1
hard-negative false merges: 0/3
```

Final default ring smoke:

```text
items: 2208
positive recall: 850/850
hard-negative false merges: 0/1358

```

Final dense all-cross compact smoke:

positive recall: 280/280
hard-negative false merges: 0/400
Raw nodes: 0/26551
```

Assessment: this was a real detector co-evolution loop, not just a benchmark expansion.
The generator found both an under-merge and a strict false-merge bug in the existing
release, the detector gained a narrow Rust frontend proof fact plus a shared boolean
select simplification, and the adversarial same-value/opposite-direction/wrong-value
boundaries now stay clean.

## Scalar absolute-value coevolution: loops 153-160

The next broad frontier used the prioritizer's highest-scoring partially-covered axis:
`numeric_minmax_abs`. The strict slice was deliberately limited to scalar absolute value,
not arbitrary min/max yet and not Ruby/Rust dynamic method forms. The target equivalence is
an explicit sign-normalizing conditional and a proven absolute-value builtin over the same
numeric coordinate.

| loop | pressure | change | measured result |
|---|---|---|---:|
| 153 | real-corpus priority | choose `numeric_minmax_abs` over the narrow `property_type_guard` because scalar numeric idioms are all-language and high-frequency | prioritizer: 7,037 raw hits across 93 repos and 8 languages |
| 154 | generator adversary | add `axis_scalar_abs_*` proposals with builtin identity, signed-identity boundary, wrong-value boundary, and shadowed-`Math` boundary | focused manifest generated 77 items: 18 positives, 59 negatives |
| 155 | baseline measurement | pre-loop release already handled Python/C but missed JS/TS/embedded, Go, Java, and most cross-surface pairs | baseline: 4/18 positives, 0/59 false merges |
| 156 | detector strengthening | lower JS/TS `Math.abs` with `Math` shadow checks, lower Java `Math.abs` in the Java frontend, and canonicalize Go `math.Abs` in idioms | focused candidate reached 18/18 before shadow hardening |
| 157 | soundness counterattack | local shadowed `Math` exposed that generic normalize-time `Math.abs` canonicalization was unsound; narrow normalize idiom to Go `math.Abs` and keep Java/JS in frontends | shadowed-`Math` false merges returned to 0 |
| 158 | focused/core gates | run focused proposal and numeric core gates | focused: 9/9 positives, 0/32 false merges, Raw 0; core selected 39/77, 15/15 and 0/24 |
| 159 | aggregate validation | run default ring, same-surface, and dense all-cross compact gates | ring 868/868 and 0/1,417; same-surface 608/608 and 0/1,054; dense compact 294/294 and 0/424 |
| 160 | scope decision | leave Ruby/Rust `.abs` method forms and scalar min/max for later slices until receiver type or builtin identity is provable | strict abs slice closed |

Final focused scalar-abs gate:

positive recall: 294/294
hard-negative false merges: 0/424
Raw nodes: 0/27842
```

Assessment: this loop followed the adversarial co-evolution pattern well. The generator
created a broad strict frontier, the baseline showed real under-merge, the detector gained
new language-specific proof facts, and the shadow boundary forced a soundness correction
before promotion. The remaining work on this axis should be scalar min/max and typed
Ruby/Rust abs only after their receiver/builtin identity can be proven.

## Scalar min/max coevolution: loops 161-168

This loop widened `numeric_minmax_abs` from absolute value into strict scalar two-way
selection. The target equivalence is a conditional choice over the same two numeric
coordinates and a proven builtin `min`/`max` form. It deliberately excludes dynamic
receiver methods and keeps JS/TS `Math` calls behind shadowing checks.

| loop | pressure | change | measured result |
|---|---|---|---:|
| 161 | generator adversary | add `axis_scalar_min_*` and `axis_scalar_max_*` proposals: builtin identity, wrong-value boundary, shadowed-`Math` boundary, and min/max direction mutation | focused manifest generated 118 items: 36 positives, 82 negatives |
| 162 | baseline measurement | compare installed/release baseline with the generated focused corpus | baseline: 0/36 positives, 0/82 false merges |
| 163 | value graph strengthening | treat 2-arg `Builtin::Min`/`Builtin::Max` as scalar `Bin(MIN/MAX)` choices while preserving 1-arg collection reductions | targeted cross-language min test passed |
| 164 | language proof facts | canonicalize Python/C bare `min/max` and `fmin/fmax`, Go `math.Min/Max`, JS/TS safe `Math.min/max`, and Java `Math.min/max` | candidate focused: 36/36 positives, 0/82 false merges |
| 165 | soundness counterattack | keep shadowed JS/TS `Math` as ordinary calls and preserve wrong-value plus min/max direction boundaries | shadowed/wrong/direction negatives: 0 false merges |
| 166 | focused/core gates | run proposal-focused and numeric core gates on the release binary | focused: 18/18 positives, 0/46 false merges, Raw 0; core selected 69/195, 24/24 and 0/45 |
| 167 | aggregate validation | run default ring, same-surface, and dense all-cross compact gates | ring 904/904 and 0/1,499; same-surface 626/626 and 0/1,100; dense compact 304/304 and 0/445 |
| 168 | scope decision | keep Ruby/Rust dynamic `.abs`/`.min`/`.max` method forms out until builtin/receiver identity can be proven | strict scalar min/max slice closed |

Raw nodes: 0/28962
```

Assessment: this was a real detector co-evolution loop, not benchmark-only expansion.
The generator exposed a broad strict under-merge class, the detector gained shared value
graph semantics plus language-specific proof facts, and the adversarial negatives
confirmed that `min`/`max` direction, wrong coordinates, and shadowed `Math` do not merge.

## Map key-membership coevolution: loops 169-176

This loop widened the membership frontier from static literal collections into dynamic map
key-presence predicates. The strict slice covers surfaces where key membership has a
direct, high-confidence proof shape without using JS/TS runtime type information: Python,
Go, Java, Ruby, and Rust.

| loop | pressure | change | measured result |
|---|---|---|---:|
| 169 | real-corpus priority | choose `membership_contains` over narrow `property_type_guard` because key-membership patterns have broader multi-language spread | prioritizer: 22,979 raw matches across 99 repos and 7 languages |
| 170 | generator adversary | add `map_key_membership` with identity, wrong-key, wrong-map, and value-membership boundaries | focused manifest generated 50 items: 10 positives, 40 negatives |
| 171 | baseline measurement | compare the release baseline with the focused map-key corpus | baseline: 0/10 positives, 0/40 false merges |
| 172 | detector strengthening | canonicalize Python `__contains__`, Java `containsKey`/`keySet().contains`, Ruby `key?`/`has_key?`, Rust `contains_key`/`get().is_some`, and Go map lookup-ok assignment to `Contains(key, map)` | candidate focused: 10/10 positives, 0/40 false merges |
| 173 | regression counterattack | full CLI tests caught that the new `contains` arm shadowed literal Rust array membership; merge keySet handling into the existing literal-membership branch | literal collection membership restored; targeted map-key test still passed |
| 174 | focused/core gates | run proposal-focused and map-key core gates on the release binary | focused: 5/5 positives, 0/20 false merges, Raw 0; core selected 26/50, 9/9 and 0/17 |
| 175 | aggregate validation | run default ring, same-surface, and dense all-cross compact gates | ring 914/914 and 0/1,539; same-surface 631/631 and 0/1,120; dense compact 312/312 and 0/462 |
| 176 | scope decision | leave JS/TS `Map.has` and ambiguous `contains/includes` until receiver type or literal construction is proven | strict map-key slice closed |

Preflight comparison before rebuilding the release binary:

hard-negative false merges: 0/462
Raw nodes: 0/29753
```

Assessment: this loop followed the intended adversarial co-evolution pattern. The
generator found a real multi-language under-merge class, the detector gained both shared
canonicalization and Go frontend lowering, and the regression suite forced a process
correction so broad `contains` support did not weaken existing literal-membership safety.

## Typed map-default coevolution: loops 177-184

This loop closes the next strict slice of the broader `map_default_lookup` frontier:
typed/dynamic maps in Go, Java, and Rust. It deliberately stays separate from the earlier
Python/Ruby `literal_map_default_lookup` slice. JS/TS object or `Map.get() ?? fallback`
forms remain open until receiver type or construction facts make the absent-value
semantics strict.

| loop | pressure | change | measured result |
|---|---|---|---:|
| 177 | scope split | choose typed map fallback over broad JS/TS defaulting because Go/Java/Rust expose map receiver, key, presence, and fallback coordinates directly | new `map_default_lookup` capability slice selected |
| 178 | generator adversary | add `axis_map_fallback_*` proposals with identity, wrong-key, wrong-default, wrong-map, and semantic-mutation siblings | focused manifest generated 15 items: 3 positives, 12 negatives |
| 179 | baseline measurement | compare the existing release binary with the focused corpus before rebuilding release | baseline: 1/3 positives, 0/12 false merges; misses were Java and Rust API/default forms |
| 180 | detector strengthening | lower Java `getOrDefault` and Rust `get(key).unwrap_or(default)` to `GetOrDefault`, and fold `Phi(key in map, map[key]/map.get(key), fallback)` to the same value-graph node | candidate focused: 3/3 positives, 0/12 false merges |
| 181 | focused ring check | run cross-surface focused ring for Go, Java, and Rust | 6/6 positives, 0/24 false merges |
| 182 | regression test | add `map_default_lookup_converges_cross_language_with_boundaries` | full equivalence suite: 114/114 passed |
| 183 | compact gate | run `GATE=core AXIS=map_default_lookup` on the release candidate | selected 17/30; 5/5 positives, 0/12 false merges, Raw 0 |
| 184 | pause point | stop after this loop per operator request, with large default-ring/dense validation deferred | ready to resume from the notes below |

```

Pause/resume note: this is a clean stopping point. On the next session, do not restart the
same loop. First run one periodic broader validation if needed:

```sh
GATE=full AXIS=map_default_lookup NOSE=target/release/nose ./scripts/type4-smoke.sh
GATE=core CROSS=all NOSE=target/release/nose OUT_DIR=/tmp/nose-type4-smoke-resume-all ./scripts/type4-smoke.sh
```

Then refresh the prioritizer with cache and choose the next cost-effective strict axis:

```sh
python3 bench/type4/prioritize_frontier.py \
  --cache /tmp/nose-frontier-priorities.cache.json \
  --json-out /tmp/nose-frontier-priorities.json \
  --markdown-out bench/type4/FRONTIER_PRIORITIES.md
```

Assessment: this was a real detector improvement, not just benchmark growth. The baseline
already handled the Go same-shape case because both sides used the explicit lookup-ok
fallback, but it missed Java/Rust API forms. The detector now has a shared strict
`GetOrDefault(map, key, fallback)` proof fact and keeps all coordinate-changing adversaries
separate.

## Ruby numeric micro-batch coevolution: loops 185-192

This loop adopts the faster cadence: one co-evolution loop can carry about three
same-axis micro-frontiers, provided each micro-frontier has its own proposal prefix and the
batch ends with a shared compact gate. The selected batch is `numeric_minmax_abs` for Ruby:
`value.abs`, `[left, right].min`, and `[left, right].max`.

| loop | pressure | change | measured result |
|---|---|---|---:|
| 185 | acceleration rule | switch from one frontier per loop to a same-axis micro-batch of roughly three additions | batch target: Ruby scalar `abs`, `min`, `max` |
| 186 | prioritization correction | reject `property_type_guard` as detector-work for now because focused probing showed current strict positives already converge | next real miss chosen from `numeric_minmax_abs` |
| 187 | baseline measurement | generate `axis_scalar*` focused corpus after adding Ruby cases, then scan with the previous release binary | baseline: 27/30 positives, 0/85 false merges; all 3 misses were Ruby |
| 188 | generator expansion | include Ruby in scalar numeric support and emit `value.abs` plus two-element array `.min/.max` adversaries | focused corpus: 115 items, 30 positives, 85 hard negatives |
| 189 | detector strengthening | canonicalize method-form `abs` to `Abs(value)` and literal two-element `.min/.max` to scalar `Min/Max(left, right)` | candidate focused: 30/30 positives, 0/85 false merges |
| 190 | regression tests | extend scalar numeric cross-language tests with Ruby `abs`, `[left, right].min`, and `[left, right].max` | full equivalence suite: 114/114 passed |
| 191 | compact axis gate | run `GATE=core AXIS=numeric_minmax_abs` on the release candidate | selected 73/215; 25/25 positives, 0/48 false merges, Raw 0 |
| 192 | broad compact gate | run `GATE=core CROSS=all` to catch cross-axis regressions | selected 792/5101; 318/318 positives, 0/474 false merges, Raw 0 |

Focused baseline/candidate comparison:

```text
baseline focused: items=115, positive=27/30, misses=3, false_merges=0/85
candidate focused: items=115, positive=30/30, misses=0, false_merges=0/85
delta: +3 positive hits, +0 false merges
```

Final release focused numeric gate:

```text
GATE=focused PROPOSAL_PREFIX=axis_scalar NOSE=target/release/nose ./scripts/type4-smoke.sh
items: 115
positive recall: 30/30
hard-negative false merges: 0/85
Raw nodes: 0/4131
```

Final release compact all-cross gate:

```text
GATE=core CROSS=all NOSE=target/release/nose ./scripts/type4-smoke.sh
selected items: 792/5101
positive recall: 318/318
hard-negative false merges: 0/474
Raw nodes: 0/30656
```

Assessment: this batch changed the detector, not just the benchmark. The previous release
missed exactly the three new Ruby numeric positives and already rejected the adversarial
hard negatives. The candidate closes all three without increasing false merges. The faster
cadence is viable when the batch stays inside one semantic axis and the end gate is compact
and cross-axis.
