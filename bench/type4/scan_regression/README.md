# Semantic-scan regression harness

A repeatable harness for the **product** semantic scan path, so detector changes
(#33 and later) can be checked for **runtime regression** and **output-volume
drift** without any chat history. Issue: #37. Part of the
[Type-4 benchmark factory](../README.md); see also the
[scan JSON contract](../../../docs/scan-json.md).

Everything a fresh worker needs is in this directory:

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `scan_regression.py` | the harness (`baseline`, `compare`, `cache`, `selftest` subcommands) |
| `subset.json` | the small, language-diverse repo subset to measure |
| `baseline.v1.json` | the recorded reference snapshot (binary identity + per-repo canonical output + runtime medians) |
| `compare-summary.md` | the latest `compare` markdown report (regenerated each run) |

## The one fixed command

Output drift is always measured on the product path, and only that path:

```
nose scan <repo> --mode semantic --format json --top 0
```

The hidden `nose detect` path uses a different detector/scoring route, so it is
**never** used as a substitute for product family drift — this harness does not
call it at all. Candidate counts (`candidate_pairs`) are not exposed on the product
JSON today, so the harness does not report them; it records only what
`--format json` and `NOSE_TIME` emit on the product path.

## Quick start

A fresh worktree has **no corpus** (`bench/repos` is gitignored). Either populate it
with `bench/setup_repos.sh`, or point `--repos-root` at an existing checkout (e.g. the
main worktree's `bench/repos`). Build the binary you want to measure:

```sh
cargo build --release --bin nose
```

Record a baseline from a known-good binary (usually `main`):

```sh
python3 bench/type4/scan_regression/scan_regression.py baseline \
    --nose ./target/release/nose \
    --repos-root /path/to/main/bench/repos \
    --build-ref "main@$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
```

Then build your change and compare:

```sh
python3 bench/type4/scan_regression/scan_regression.py compare \
    --nose ./target/release/nose \
    --repos-root /path/to/main/bench/repos
```

`compare` writes `compare-summary.md` and prints it. It always runs the corpus-free HoF
value-graph budget smoke before any repo scans, so a fresh worktree with no `bench/repos`
still exercises the generated deep/wide HoF budget cases. Real-repo drift triggers are
investigation prompts, not merge blockers; HoF budget failures are hard failures because
they guard unbounded representation growth. Pass `--strict` to make real-repo triggers
non-zero once the thresholds are calibrated.

Run the corpus-free unit checks for the canonicalization/gate logic:

```sh
python3 bench/type4/scan_regression/scan_regression.py selftest
```

## What gets compared (output drift)

The `--top 0` full JSON is canonicalized so **family order and ranking tie-breaks are
ignored** and locations are made **repo-relative**. Each scan runs with `cwd` set to the
repo and a `.` target, so the CLI emits repo-relative paths and `family_id`,
`product_json_bytes`, and the location keys are **independent of where the corpus is
checked out** — the committed baseline compares cleanly whether the corpus lives under the
main worktree or any other path you pass to `--repos-root`. Per repo we record and diff:

- `total_families` / `shown_families`
- `product_json_bytes` — payload byte size with the volatile `tool_version` removed
- `kind_counts` — unit kinds across all locations (`Block`, `Function`, `Method`, …)
- `span_buckets` — families bucketed by `mean_lines` (`1`, `2-3`, `4-10`, `11-30`, `31+`)
- `recommended_surface_counts` — family product placement counts for `default`,
  `review`, `hidden`, and reserved `debug`
- `family_shape_counts` — whole-only, all-fragment, and mixed family counts
- per family — **keyed by the normalized location set, not `family_id`** (so deliberate
  `family_id` scheme migrations and accidental ID regressions stay reviewable):
  `family_id` (kept as an attribute and a drift signal),
  `members`, `location_count`, `mean_lines`, `recommended_surface`, family shape,
  fragment count, per-kind counts, family-local fragment kind/reason-code counts,
  family-local kind/reason-by-surface counts, fragment-only span buckets,
  enclosing-unit recovery, and the sorted locations. `distinct_location_sets` is
  recorded so a true location-set collision would surface rather than collapse silently.
- `fragment_kind_counts` / `reason_code_counts` — exact-fragment metadata buckets from
  product scan JSON. #45 makes these live for current output, so fragment/reason drift is
  visible separately from generic `Block` counts.
- `fragment_kind_surface_counts` / `reason_code_surface_counts` — exact-fragment proof
  buckets crossed with `recommended_surface`, so calibration drift is visible before it
  changes detector output.
- `fragment_line_span_buckets` / `fragment_token_span_buckets` — fragment-location span
  distributions. Line spans use the same buckets as family `mean_lines`; token spans use
  `0`, `1-8`, `9-23`, `24-49`, `50-99`, and `100+`.
- `enclosing_unit_recovery_counts` — recovered vs missing exact enclosing unit metadata
  across fragment locations.

These #51 C1 metrics are computed by the harness from stable scan JSON. They do not add
new scan JSON fields and do not change detector acceptance, ranking, or `--top 0`
visibility.

Family-local fragment metadata is intentional. Global fragment/reason buckets catch
overall distribution drift, but they cannot catch a balanced swap where two families keep
the same `recommended_surface` and the repo-wide buckets stay identical while each
family's exact proof shape changes. The per-family records therefore include
`fragment_kind_counts`, `reason_code_counts`, `fragment_kind_surface_counts`, and
`reason_code_surface_counts`, and `compare` treats those as family drift.

`baseline` runs each repo `runtime_repeats` times and asserts the canonical output is
**identical across runs** on one binary — a determinism guard. A mismatch aborts before
any drift comparison can be trusted.

## What gets measured (runtime)

Runtime is measured **without `--cache-dir`** (cache state would mix #33's
normalize/extract cost with cache effects). Each repo is run `runtime_repeats` times
(default 5, minimum should be ≥ 3) and the **median** wall-clock and median per-phase
timings (`NOSE_TIME` stages: `lower`, `normalize+extract`, `candidates`, `score`,
`cluster`, `groups`, `contiguous`) are recorded.

Wall-clock is **not portable across machines or load**. For a meaningful runtime
comparison, record the baseline and run `compare` **on the same machine**: build `main`,
`baseline`, then build your change and `compare`. When the binary `sha256` matches the
baseline, the summary says so explicitly and any delta is environment noise. The
committed `baseline.v1.json` runtime numbers are a snapshot from one machine; the
**output drift** in it is portable, the **runtime** is not.

Every `compare` also runs a generated HoF value-graph smoke that does not depend on
`bench/repos`. It creates a deep filter/map/reduce chain and a wide sum of filter/map/reduce
chains, then records:

- `nose features` wall time;
- semantic `nose scan --mode semantic --format json --top 0` wall time;
- per-case token counts, value-fingerprint-node counts, and return-fingerprint-node counts.

Those HoF smoke budgets live in `HOF_RUNTIME_BUDGETS` and `HOF_CASE_BUDGETS`. Unlike the
real-repo runtime drift thresholds, they are hard compare failures.

For deeper profiling, measure the current checkout instead of resuming from an old hotspot
list:

```sh
NOSE_TIME=1 NOSE_TIME_UNITS=1 NOSE_TIME_UNIT_SUMMARY=1 \
  target/release/nose scan <repo> --mode semantic --format json --top 0 \
  > /tmp/nose-profile.json 2> /tmp/nose-profile.err
```

`NOSE_TIME_UNITS=1` prints individual units above the internal unit threshold, while
`NOSE_TIME_UNIT_SUMMARY=1` prints per-file/per-kind aggregates. Use both to distinguish a
many-file fixed cost from a single-unit value-DAG problem or candidate/scoring work. Keep
durable conclusions in this README, `compare-summary.md`, or `../ITERATIONS.md`; `/tmp`
outputs are scratch.

## Compare summary identity

`compare-summary.md` is a committed generated report. Its `current` `source_git_describe`
and `build_ref` identify the checkout and binary that generated the report, not
necessarily the later commit that stores the markdown. This avoids a self-referential
hash: if the report recorded the artifact commit itself, committing the report would
change the commit hash it claims to contain. For committed summaries, use an explicit
generator label such as `issue-51-generator@<sha>` or `main@<sha>` and treat that as the
reproducible input identity.

Cache performance is a **separate** mode that never feeds the baseline:

```sh
python3 bench/type4/scan_regression/scan_regression.py cache --nose ./target/release/nose
```

It reports no-cache vs cold (fresh temp cache) vs warm (reused cache) wall-clock per
repo, keeping the cache effect isolated from the normalize/extract cost.

## Thresholds = investigation triggers, not merge blockers

Until calibrated, a single noisy real-repo wall-clock run must not fail a build.
`compare` flags these repo drift signals for a human to look at, not to gate:

| signal | trigger |
|---|---|
| family set | any added/removed location set, or a family changing shape (members/locations/mean_lines/kinds/surface/fragment metadata) |
| `total_families` | any change |
| `product_json_bytes` | > 5% change |
| kind / span / fragment / reason-code / surface / enclosing-unit buckets | any count change |
| runtime (per-phase + wall median) | > 25% growth **and** > 5 ms absolute (loose + floored because it's noisy) |

The repo drift thresholds live in `THRESHOLDS` at the top of `scan_regression.py`. Tune
them there as the harness is calibrated, then turn on `--strict` for the signals you
trust. The generated HoF smoke budgets are separate hard gates in `HOF_RUNTIME_BUDGETS`
and `HOF_CASE_BUDGETS`.

## Subset (and the #36 link)

`subset.json` lists one repo per supported imperative corpus language plus a second
small Go repo, all intended to stay sub-second for single-pass scans so the no-cache
repeats stay cheap. `liquid` (ruby) and `junit5` (java) also appear in the Type-4
frontier (`../real_frontier.v1.json`, #36), so the subset already overlaps live
frontier work. `swift-metrics` is the Swift bring-up representative because its pinned
checkout is small. To measure #36's next batch, edit `repos` (and `repos_root` if
needed) — the harness is fully data-driven.

## Refreshing the committed baseline

Re-record `baseline.v1.json` when `main`'s product output legitimately changes (a
reviewed detector change merges). Regenerate from `main` with the `baseline` command
above and commit the result, so the snapshot keeps tracking accepted product behavior.
The committed baseline carries its own recorded repo list for stable compares; after a
supported-language subset change, the next baseline refresh is what brings the new subset
repo into `compare`.
