# Semantic kernel roadmap

Back to [semantic-kernel](semantic-kernel.md). Current code shape is recorded in
[semantic-kernel-snapshot](semantic-kernel-snapshot.md).

This page tracks decisions, history, and remaining work for the semantic kernel
and pack ecosystem.

## Decisions

1. **All language and library semantics should eventually enter through packs.**
   First-party languages are not special at the API boundary; they may be compiled
   into nose, but they should use the same pack contracts as external languages.

2. **nose certifies only first-party packs.** External pack providers own their
   semantic claims. Users own the decision to enable them. nose owns the
   extension contract, schema and structural validation, fail-closed execution,
   and provenance reporting. Semantic correctness, conformance evidence, and
   enablement risk for external packs stay with the provider and user, except
   for first-party/default packs that nose ships and tests.

3. **Packs emit evidence, not verdicts.** A pack can emit facts, contracts, and
   protocol operations. It cannot mint fingerprints, bypass laws, or approve exact
   clones.

4. **Language core and library semantics are separate layers.** Evaluation order,
   truthiness, overloadability, and exception behavior belong to language core.
   `sum`, `Iterator::map`, `Array.prototype.map`, RxJS `Observable.map`, and NumPy
   vector operations belong to stdlib/library packs mapped onto protocols.

5. **Demand and effect are first-class.** Lazy evaluation, short-circuiting,
   iterators, async/futures, and observables cannot be accurately modeled with a
   simple purity flag. Exact laws need demand and effect preconditions.

6. **Unknown stays fail-closed.** Missing type, receiver, symbol, version,
   shadowing, or effect evidence must block exact semantic acceptance. It may
   still inform `near` scoring.

7. **Selectors are not proof.** A function or method name is only a selector.
   Exact contracts must also declare and check the language, symbol/namespace,
   arity, receiver/protocol, shadowing, import, version, overload, demand, and
   effect obligations that make that selector mean the claimed operation.

8. **Source facts are evidence, not semantics.** Source-origin facts preserve
   distinctions that the shared IL erases, such as construct syntax, literal
   surface, and equality/operator family. They can feed exact contracts only
   through kernel-defined fact kinds and contract preconditions; they do not mint
   fingerprints or approve equivalence directly.

## History

- The original architecture lowered every supported language into one shared IL,
  then normalized toward common fingerprints.
- The value graph became the behavioral fingerprint substrate, separating exact
  semantic matching from fuzzy structural candidate generation.
- The independent interpreter oracle was added to test fingerprint-equal units
  against concrete behavior and catch behavior-changing canonicalizations.
- Lean proof obligations were added for proof-sensitive rules.
- Exact fragments gained explicit contracts, effect classifications, and
  fail-closed receiver/place boundaries.
- Dogfooding surfaced repeated per-language frontend shapes; safe common helpers
  moved into `lower.rs`, while grammar-specific parallelism remained explicit.
- Documentation review in PR #89 clarified the current limits: exact Type-4 is a
  modeled subset, not arbitrary semantic equivalence.
- The semantic-kernel direction was chosen to make language and library semantics
  an explicit extension boundary rather than scattered engine code.
- The first internal facade landed as `nose-semantics`, wrapping first-party
  language/profile predicates and API contracts while the rest of the pipeline is
  migrated.
- Name-only contracts were narrowed: JS/TS `Map`/`Set` constructors, JS-like
  `.then`, untyped JS collection methods, and Rust iterator adapters now require
  explicit proof or remain exact-closed.
- Additional call surfaces moved behind proof-gated contracts: JS/TS
  `filter(...).length`, Rust `get(key).is_some()`, Java `keySet().contains`,
  and Java `Stream.count()` require receiver/protocol or map proof. Ruby untyped
  `Enumerable` surfaces, including `.each`/`.each_with_index` block loops, and
  scalar/array numeric helpers remain closed until comparable proof facts exist.
- New value-graph rewrites began moving into named `rules/*` modules with
  mechanical formal-obligation pairing; `clamp` is the current proof-backed
  example.
- Per-semantic parameter recognizers were folded into `is_param_value`, making
  `ParamSemantic` the current internal vocabulary for receiver/domain proof
  facts until packs provide versioned evidence records.
- Rust scalar integer methods (`abs`, `min`, `max`, `clamp`) now consume a
  language-, signature-, and integer-domain-constrained first-party contract
  instead of a bare method-name recognizer. Float/NaN-sensitive methods remain a
  separate future contract.
- Exact fragment IL-surface proofs for Java `this.field`, Java `return this`,
  non-overloadable C/Go/Java index assignment, and single-item builder append
  calls moved into `nose-semantics`, so predicate and contract paths no longer
  duplicate those language/API gates.
- The first receiver-domain evidence facade landed as `DomainEvidence`.
  Frontend `ParamSemantic` facts still provide the current evidence source, but
  normalize and detect exact gates now consume the kernel-facing domain
  vocabulary so pack-provided evidence can replace the source fact later.
- Rust stdlib path contracts for `Some`/`Option::Some`,
  `None`/`Option::None`, `Option::and_then`, and `Vec::new` moved into the
  kernel facade with explicit shadow-root obligations. The caller still proves
  local shadow safety, and the Rust frontend preserves `if let` pattern tests
  instead of lowering `Some`/`None` directly to null/not-null before that proof.
- Java collection/map factory selectors, Python free-name/imported collection
  factories, Rust std collection/map factory paths, Ruby `Set.new`, and JS-like
  `new Map`/`new Set` moved behind internal `LibraryApiContract` rows in
  `nose-semantics`. Normalize and strict exact gates now consume the same API
  identity/result source while keeping local import, require, shadow, mutation,
  constructor-syntax, and entry-shape proof at the caller.
- Java empty `ArrayList`/`LinkedList` constructor lowering now consumes a
  `LibraryApiContract` `java.util` constructor row instead of a raw simple-name
  check. Simple names need import proof and no local type shadow before they can
  seed exact builder-loop equivalence.
- Membership and map-key membership recognition now uses language-scoped method
  contracts before normalization or strict exact matching assigns containment
  semantics. This intentionally closes old name-only paths such as JavaScript
  `.contains(...)`, which had no first-party JS membership contract.
- Java stream source adapters are now proof-gated: receiver `.stream()` requires
  exact iterable evidence, and static `Arrays.stream(xs)` requires the
  `java.util.Arrays` import binding with no local `Arrays` type shadow.
- Cross-file immutable import replacement now copies the provider's closed
  evidence subgraph required by the exported literal expression, preserving
  provider-side stdlib proofs such as `java.util.Map` for Java static imports
  only when that provider evidence exists. Copied provider nodes/evidence keep
  provider source-origin spans while dependency ids are rewired in the importer,
  so importer-local declarations do not shadow provider-proven API occurrences.
  Replacement records `ImportedLiteralSnapshot` provenance depending on the
  importer static import proof and copied provider evidence. Static import
  identity now requires `EvidenceRecord::Import`; frontends keep only untagged
  coordinate sequences in the assignment carrier, and raw sequence spelling no
  longer proves cross-file replacement or value-graph import identity.
- JS-like `Map`/`Set` constructor contracts now require construct-syntax proof.
  They were initially closed while construct-vs-call evidence was missing; the
  source-fact slice reopened proof-backed `new Map(...)`/`new Set(...)` while
  plain `Map(...)`/`Set(...)` calls stayed closed.
- Map key-view recognition moved behind contracts that distinguish collection
  views from iterator views. JS-like `Map.keys()` now requires an
  `Array.from(...)` wrapper before exact membership can consume it.
- Go composite map literal/default-zero lookup recognition moved behind shared
  contracts for the outer literal surface, per-entry surface, and supported
  zero-default payload classes.
- Map `get(key)` lookup surfaces for Java, Rust, and JS-like typed/proven maps
  moved behind an explicit map-get contract. Defaulting surfaces continue through
  the existing `GetOrDefault` method contract.
- JS-like static array `indexOf`/`findIndex` membership and their accepted
  threshold comparisons moved behind shared semantic contracts.
- Channel eligibility and pack trust were split: first-party/default status is
  provenance and enablement policy, not a semantic channel.
- Newly migrated selector contracts started carrying explicit receiver/proof
  requirements so extension APIs do not look like name-only semantic guesses.
- Python `math.prod` product-reduction recognition moved behind an imported
  namespace function contract with missing-import and overwritten-binding hard
  negatives.
- Java `Math.abs`/`Math.min`/`Math.max` moved out of frontend text-only lowering
  and into method contracts that require an unshadowed `Math` receiver.
- JS-like `undefined` moved from unconditional frontend null lowering to an
  unshadowed-global nullish contract, preserving shadowed binding hard negatives.
- Strict exact gates now consume the same nullish-global proof, so temp-bound
  JS/TS `Map.get(...)` defaulting remains exact-eligible only when `undefined`
  is the unshadowed JS-like sentinel.
- Strict exact call gates for JS-like `typeof` and `Array.isArray(...)` moved
  behind language/arity/global-shadow contracts. Regex literal `.test(...)` now
  consumes regex-literal source provenance, while ordinary string `.test(...)`
  and same-named method calls remain closed. This closes raw-name bypasses found
  after PR #101.
- Normalize idiom receiver admission for iterator identity adapters and Rust
  `zip` now consumes the same semantic contracts as value-graph/detect paths,
  closing language-blind `iter`/`zip` selector bypasses.
- JS-like `Math.abs`/`Math.min`/`Math.max` now consume method contracts with an
  unshadowed `Math` receiver, and JS record-shape guards using `Boolean(...)`
  consume a static-global function contract with an unshadowed `Boolean`
  requirement.
- Generic Python/Go free-function builtins now have `LibraryApi` occurrence
  rows. Early idiom canonicalization and value-graph two-argument
  `min(...)`/`max(...)` require admitted occurrence evidence instead of raw
  callee spelling, closing unqualified JS `min(...)`, local-shadowing, and
  missing-producer bypasses.
- Ruby `fetch(key) { fallback }` map-default handling now consumes an explicit
  zero-arg-lambda fallback argument contract, and Go `slices.Contains` value-graph
  membership proof consumes the imported namespace carried by the method contract
  instead of spelling the namespace locally.
- Imported immutable literal replacement and exact module-binding gates now share
  stronger mutation evidence for top-level place writes such as
  `LOOKUP[key] = value`, closing importer-side direct-write false exact cases.
- Value-graph and oracle field state now preserve receiver+field identity instead
  of caching by field name alone. Same-place readback and distinct-field
  commutation remain open, while cross-receiver reads/writes with the same field
  name stay exact-distinct.
- Lowered `Seq` surface admission now goes through `SeqSurfaceContract` instead
  of local raw-string allowlists. The contract separates exact-tree safety,
  membership collection admission, map-entry-list admission, imported-literal
  eligibility, and value-graph tags, so Go `composite_literal` map surfaces no
  longer leak into generic collection semantics. Untagged `Seq` is now
  non-semantic by default; static membership and idiom receiver gates consume
  explicit membership-collection surface proof.
- JS/TS object surfaces were narrowed: static property keys remain exact
  map/object entries, computed property names are exact-closed until key
  evaluation semantics are contracted, and object `.length` no longer lowers to
  collection `Len` merely because the receiver is a `Seq`.
- Java `java.util.*` wildcard proof for empty `ArrayList`/`LinkedList`
  constructors now closes when another package explicitly imports the same
  simple type, matching Java import resolution before the constructor surface can
  enter the collection builder contract.
- Same-unit value-graph field readback now uses the receiver/place proof shape
  rather than an arbitrary evaluated receiver value, so aliases and computed
  call-result receivers stay exact-closed until pack-facing place evidence
  exists.
- Import binding and namespace proof interpretation now goes through a typed
  `ImportFactKind`/`ImportFact` facade in `nose-semantics`. Frontend emitters,
  imported immutable literal replacement, normalize idiom gates, value-graph
  import proof, and strict exact gates initially moved behind that shared facade
  instead of parsing raw import `Seq` tags locally.
- Imported immutable literal replacement now consumes evidence-only import facts,
  copies provider evidence with preserved source-origin anchors and rewired
  dependency ids, and records `ImportedLiteralSnapshot` provenance. This closes
  raw import-tag fallback and missing-provider-proof cases such as Java
  `Map.of(...)` without `import java.util.Map`.
- TypeScript type-only imports no longer emit runtime import facts: whole
  `import type ...` declarations and type-only named specifiers stay outside
  exact library/API proof.
- Imported literal provenance now treats provider-side opaque argument escapes
  such as `mutate(LOOKUP)` as mutation risk, so exported bindings must be direct,
  unescaped immutable values before cross-file replacement can copy them.
- Strict exact collection-membership receiver proof no longer falls back from
  "not a known collection surface" to "any strict-safe tree." Top-level immutable
  collection and map bindings are tracked separately from generic immutable names,
  preserving supported module-level collection cases while closing unproven
  receiver expressions.
- Exact fragment append-effect recognition now consumes canonical append evidence
  instead of raw method selectors. Untyped `push`/`append`/`add` calls no longer
  prove append fragments by name; first-party language/library paths must first
  prove the receiver or active-builder contract and lower the call to
  `Builtin::Append`.
- Primitive operator gates now enter through `OperatorSemantics` contracts for
  comparison transforms, comparison laws, cardinality thresholds, static
  `indexOf`/`findIndex` thresholds, and source membership operators. Algebra,
  CFG normalization, value-graph comparison/count rewrites, and strict exact
  static-membership gates consume the shared contract vocabulary. JS `in` no
  longer inherits collection-membership exact safety from the shared `Op::In`
  token; only Python `in` currently has a first-party membership-operator
  contract.
- Source facts landed for construct syntax, regex literals, and selected
  equality/operator provenance. Exact consumers now reopen proof-backed JS-like
  `new Map(...)`/`new Set(...)`, regex literal `.test(...)`, and strict JS-like
  static membership callbacks while closing plain constructor calls, string
  `.test(...)`, loose equality, and `instanceof` for those exact contracts.
- The first shared `EvidenceRecord` substrate landed for source, domain, import,
  and sequence-surface facts. First-party frontends now mirror compatibility
  `SourceFact`, `ParamTypeFact`, raw import `Seq`, and lowered `Seq` surface
  facts into records with ids, anchors, provenance, dependencies, and status.
  `nose-semantics` lookups fail closed on ambiguous/conflicting evidence before
  falling back to compatibility storage.
- Source-origin and parameter-domain proof later became evidence-only: the
  `SourceFact` and `ParamTypeFact` side-table mirrors were removed from IL
  storage, first-party frontends emit `Source` and `Domain` records directly, and
  semantic lookups no longer reopen those proof paths from compatibility mirrors
  when evidence is missing.
- Symbol-identity evidence now represents static imported binding/namespace
  aliases. Normalize idiom admission, value-graph namespace fallbacks, and strict
  exact gates have started consuming this helper layer instead of each re-scanning
  raw import assignment shapes. Provider/imported immutable literal replacement
  also now rejects direct module-binding mutations such as `LOOKUP.push(...)`.
- JS/TS static-global value occurrences now emit `UnshadowedGlobal` evidence for
  first-party globals such as `Math`, `console`, `Array`, `Map`, `Set`, and
  `undefined` when no local shadow is proven. JS/TS `Math.*` no longer lowers
  directly to builtins in the frontend; normalize consumes the preserved
  `Field(Var(global), method)` shape through symbol-proof contracts instead.
- Selected JS/TS qualified static global paths now emit `QualifiedGlobal`
  evidence. `Object.hasOwn` and
  `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call` are dependencies of own-property guard
  evidence, while `Array.from` gates JS-like map-key iterator wrappers.
  `Array.isArray` emits the same path evidence for strict exact call gates. Full
  namespace-member resolution remains open.
- Value-graph import identity now consumes sequence `Import` evidence into
  dedicated internal `ImportNamespace`/`ImportBinding` value ops instead of
  treating raw `ValOp::Seq(import_*)` shapes as proof objects. Imported
  binding/namespace symbol helpers also no longer accept raw import assignment
  RHS parsing as an exact proof fallback.
- JS/TS record-shape guards now emit dedicated `Guard::JsRecordShape` evidence
  with subject, null/truthiness, equality-form, and API-dependency obligations.
  Strict exact and value-graph paths require that evidence plus
  `SequenceSurface(RecordGuard)`, so raw `Seq("record_guard")` no longer acts as
  a proof object by tag spelling.
- JS/TS own-property guards now emit dedicated `Guard::JsOwnProperty` evidence
  with an asserted supported `QualifiedGlobal` API dependency. Strict exact and
  value-graph map-default paths require that evidence plus
  `SequenceSurface(OwnPropertyGuard)`, so raw `Seq("own_property_guard")` no
  longer acts as proof by tag spelling or API-looking text.
- Go zero-map literal/default lookup now requires evidence for both
  `SequenceSurface(GoCompositeMapLiteral)` and `SequenceSurface(GoMapEntry)`.
  The compatibility tags still exist as lowered surfaces, but exact admission no
  longer comes from raw `composite_literal`/`keyed_element` strings alone.
- Non-factory library/API surfaces started moving into `LibraryApiContract`
  identity/result rows. Map-key views and wrappers, map `get`/defaulting method
  calls, selected static JS-like helpers, regex-literal `.test`, Python
  `math.prod`, promise `.then`, iterator identity adapters, Java
  `Arrays.stream`, and existing language-scoped method-call gates now share the
  same API-contract source across normalize, value-graph, and strict exact
  consumers.
- The first `LibraryApi` occurrence evidence vertical landed for selected
  JS-like static/global APIs. First-party lowering emits dependency-backed call
  evidence for `Array.from`, `Array.isArray`, `Boolean`, `new Map`, and
  `new Set`; value-graph and strict exact consumers for those surfaces consult
  it first and close legacy fallback on conflicting, ambiguous, or
  dependency-broken records.
- The next `LibraryApi` occurrence evidence slice extended the same
  dependency-backed path to selected import/source-backed APIs: Python
  `collections.deque`, Python `math.prod`, Java `java.util` static
  factories/adapters (`List.of`, `Set.of`, `Arrays.asList`, `Map.of`,
  `Map.ofEntries`, `Map.entry`, `Arrays.stream`), and JS-like regex-literal
  `.test`. Producers emit call-site `Symbol` dependencies for imported
  binding/namespace occurrences or `Source` dependencies for regex literals;
  value-graph, idiom, and strict exact consumers consult these records first and
  close fallback on rejected records. Imported occurrence symbols now require
  binding-anchor dependencies, rebinding/local-shadow validation, span-matched
  dependencies when spans survive normalization, and Java map provider proofs no
  longer replace current receiver identity except for imported literal snapshots
  already validated in the provider module.
- The follow-up LibraryApi fallback-closure slice made those producer-covered
  surfaces require admitted occurrence evidence. Missing `LibraryApi` evidence
  now closes value-graph, idiom, strict exact, and Java map provider snapshot
  paths for JS-like static/global APIs, Python imported `collections.deque`,
  Python `math.prod`, Java `java.util` static factories/adapters, and JS-like
  regex-literal `.test`. The older import/symbol/source facts remain
  dependencies, not fallback API-identity proofs. Python aliased imports such as
  `from collections import deque as Values; Values(...)` are preserved by
  resolving the occurrence through imported-binding evidence rather than by
  comparing the local name to the exported API name.
- The same fallback-closure slice extended occurrence evidence to selected
  free-name and require-backed factories: Python builtin collection factories,
  Rust `vec!`, `Vec::new`, and selected `std::collections::*::from` factories,
  plus Ruby `require "set"; Set.new(...)`. First-party lowering now emits
  `UnshadowedGlobal`, macro-invocation `Source`, or earlier top-level
  `Import::Require` dependencies for those occurrences, and value-graph, idiom,
  strict exact, and provider snapshot consumers require admitted `LibraryApi`
  evidence instead of raw selector/path/require scans.
- Receiver-domain proof consumption moved behind a shared `DomainRequirement`
  resolver in `nose-semantics`. `Domain` evidence can now be consumed at exact
  receiver node anchors before scoped parameter compatibility evidence, and
  ambiguous/conflicting/dependency-broken receiver facts close fallback.
  Desugaring, normalize idiom canonicalization, value-graph membership,
  property, map, and integer gates, and strict exact receiver gates now share
  this resolver instead of each re-scanning parameter ids or names locally.
  `MethodReceiverContract` exposes the subset of receiver obligations that are
  domain-backed, while imported namespace, unshadowed global, map-literal,
  demand, and effect obligations remain separate checks.
- Selected first-party library/API factory result domains now produce
  node-anchored `Domain` evidence after the call occurrence has admitted
  `LibraryApi` evidence. This covers Python builtin/imported collection
  factories, Rust `Vec::new`/`vec!`/selected `std::collections::*::from`
  factories, Ruby `Set.new`, Java `List.of`/`Set.of`/zero- or multi-argument
  `Arrays.asList`/`Map.of`/`Map.ofEntries`, JS-like `new Set`/`new Map`, and
  JS-like one-argument `Array.from`. The mapping is contract-scoped and
  deliberately excludes lookalikes, Java single-argument `Arrays.asList(x)`
  without element-provenance proof, and non-container results such as
  `Map.entry`, `Array.isArray`, `Boolean`, regex `.test`, `math.prod`,
  `Arrays.stream`, map `get`, promise `.then`, iterator adapters, and generic
  method contracts.
- Immutable local/module binding domains now produce binding-anchored `Domain`
  evidence during normalization when the initializer has asserted sequence or
  result-domain evidence, the binding is single-assignment in the current scope,
  and the first-party mutation scan finds no direct binding/place mutation.
  `nose-semantics` resolves receiver-domain proof from exact receiver nodes,
  binding anchors, and scoped parameters through the same `DomainRequirement`
  helper, so value-graph and strict exact gates no longer maintain separate
  receiver-domain scanners.
- The receiver-method `LibraryApi` occurrence slice moved broad method-family
  consumers behind dependency-backed call occurrence records. First-party
  lowering now emits occurrence evidence for map `get`, map-key views, iterator
  identity adapters, and language-scoped method-call contracts only when the
  exact language/method/arity row and receiver proof are present. Normalize runs
  receiver-method refresh passes after immutable binding-domain inference and
  after final CFG/dataflow/algebra rewrites, so binding receivers such as
  `VALUES.contains(x)` can depend on the current binding or sequence-domain
  proof produced from `VALUES = List.of(...)`. Source-span evidence lookup
  re-checks the recovered source `Call` node when value-graph CSE has collapsed
  parameter receivers into spanless values, which keeps Java/TS/Python map
  defaulting aligned without accepting selector-only proof. Normalize idioms,
  value-graph rewrites, and strict exact gates for collection/map membership,
  map defaulting, map-key views, iterator adapters, Rust `zip`, and
  HOF/reduction methods now require admitted occurrence evidence instead of raw
  selector plus receiver-domain scans. Normalized `HoF` nodes produced from
  admitted method calls also remain admissible protocol receivers through their
  same-span `MethodCall(HoF(...))` occurrence record, so downstream adapters can
  consume canonicalized HOFs without trusting selector spelling alone.
- The static API occurrence slice moved Java empty collection constructors and
  JS-like static `indexOf`/`findIndex` membership behind the same
  dependency-backed occurrence boundary. `new ArrayList<>()`/
  `new LinkedList<>()` now stay as construct `Call` nodes until exact or
  wildcard `java.util` import proof admits the `LibraryApi` record; explicit
  same-name imports and local type declarations close wildcard proof. Static
  index membership now emits `LibraryApi` evidence that depends on the exact
  receiver `SequenceSurface(Collection)` fact, and value-graph/strict exact
  consumers require the admitted occurrence instead of trusting method spelling
  plus literal children. Raw `Op::In` value-graph canonicalization now also
  checks the language membership-operator contract before treating the operator
  as collection membership.
- Value-graph and structural-recursion domain gates moved from normalize-local
  `types.rs` / `Ty` inference to `nose-semantics` `ValueDomain` and `ValueLaw`
  contracts. The first contract set covers add non-concat ordering,
  numeric/boolean law preconditions, factor distribution, large formula
  compaction, and structural numeric folds. Parameter `Domain` evidence now
  feeds the shared value-domain seed for direct functions, class/container
  method fingerprints, and structural-recursion recognition, so typed
  string/sequence concatenation no longer inherits optimistic numeric add
  ordering.
- An experimental `abstraction` scan mode landed as a weak sibling claim over a
  narrow `near` subset. It emits typed literal-hole witnesses and caveats for
  refactoring-template candidates, but does not feed `semantic`, `verify`, or exact
  kernel admission.
- The abstraction witness policy is now separated from unit feature extraction as
  a small internal witness kernel. The current accepted hole remains literal-only,
  but the model records claim class, family evidence basis, checked member count,
  template format, hole role, template index, and observed literal classes so future
  type/domain/operator witnesses have a single owner.
- Abstraction scan output now requires family-wide hole agreement: every reported
  family member must fit the same normalized IL template with the same literal-leaf
  hole position. Mixed connected components are not given a weak witness merely
  because one representative pair looked actionable.
- Exact-fragment place/effect gates became evidence-authoritative for the
  producer-covered substrate. First-party normalize refreshes now upsert
  `Effect(BuilderAppendCall)` for canonical append calls,
  `Effect(NonOverloadableIndexWrite)` for C/Go/Java index assignments, and Java
  self receiver/field/write `Place`/`Effect` records after canonical rewrites.
  Exact fragment consumers no longer reopen append/index/self-field admission
  through language/shape fallback when `Effect`/`Place` evidence is missing.
- Sequence-surface exact/value consumers became evidence-only. Raw
  `Seq("array")`, `Seq("object")`, `Seq("tuple")`, Go `composite_literal`, and
  similar lowered tags no longer prove exact-tree safety, membership collection
  admission, map-entry-list shape, or value-graph sequence tags without matching
  `SequenceSurface` evidence. JS/TS `filter(...).length` also now requires the
  inner HOF call's admitted `LibraryApi` occurrence instead of a raw method
  selector. Raw Python async-looking field names no longer rewrite to sync names
  until an explicit async/sync protocol evidence path exists.
- JS/TS, Python, and Rust `await` expressions now preserve a raw async protocol
  boundary and emit `Source::Protocol(Await)` evidence instead of lowering
  directly to the operand. JS/TS and Python `yield` expressions preserve raw
  generator protocol boundaries with `Source::Protocol(Yield)`. Rust `async {}`
  and `?` also preserve raw protocol boundaries with
  `Source::Protocol(AsyncBlock)` and
  `Source::Protocol(TryPropagation)`. This closes the old exact async/sync and
  error-propagation convergence paths, plus generator/body erasure, until
  language/runtime-specific protocol contracts can prove receiver, demand,
  scheduling, suspension, exception, and effect obligations.
- Go concurrency/channel surfaces now preserve source-backed protocol
  boundaries. `go`, `defer`, channel send, channel receive, receive-status
  projection, `select`, and select cases/defaults no longer erase to ordinary
  calls, operands, or ad hoc sequence tags. Exact/value consumers stay closed
  until channel/goroutine/defer/select contracts can prove scheduling, blocking,
  close/zero-value, case-selection, demand, and effect obligations.
- Python comprehension lowering now emits source facts for list/set/dict
  comprehensions and generator expressions. Exact HOF admission consumes those
  facts: list/dict materialized surfaces preserve existing positive recall where
  modeled, returned generator/set surfaces stay closed, `len(generator)` and
  set-comprehension cardinality stay closed, and supported terminal reductions
  reopen generator/list streams only under immediate consumer demand.
- The protocol/API occurrence closure slice extended `LibraryApi` beyond
  call-only APIs. JS/TS/Java `length` property reads now require a
  `PropertyBuiltin` occurrence anchored to the `Field` node, JS-like `length()`
  is no longer a cardinality method contract, Rust `Some(...)`, `Some(_)`
  pattern selectors, and bare `None` now emit contract-backed Option occurrence
  evidence, Rust `Option::and_then` and scalar integer methods require admitted
  receiver-method occurrences, and value-graph/desugar/idiom consumers fail
  closed when those occurrence records are missing, rejected, or
  dependency-broken.

## Phase 0: documentation and vocabulary (landed)

- PR #100 defined semantic-kernel goals, non-goals, responsibility model, and
  pack kinds.
- The current implementation snapshot is recorded separately from this roadmap.
- The direction is linked from home, architecture, languages, and
  formal-soundness.
- The docs distinguish implemented facade behavior from planned external-pack
  capability.

## Phase 1: kernel facade and fail-closed migration (first slice landed)

Landed in PR #100 and PR #101:

- `nose-semantics` exists as the first compiled facade for language profiles,
  semantic facts, effect/operator/fragment predicates, stdlib/API contracts, law
  ids, and proof status.
- First-party built-in profiles now wrap many existing `Lang` matches behind
  named predicates and contracts.
- Several proof-sensitive direct `Lang`/name checks were replaced with semantic
  predicates or fail-closed contracts.
- Old name-only recognizers were narrowed when receiver, import, shadowing,
  constructor, or protocol proof was missing.
- Tests now cover language, arity, shadowing, import, receiver, and hard-negative
  obligations for the migrated facade paths.
- Parser and lowering dispatch remain unchanged.

Remaining in this phase:

- Continue replacing proof-sensitive `Lang`/selector checks that are still local
  to normalize, detect, and import proof.
- Keep behavior-changing recall reductions documented when missing evidence
  blocks exact convergence.
- Preserve the current precision gates while moving more first-party surfaces
  behind shared contracts.

## Phase 2: shared contracts for duplicated gates

- Continue moving primitive operator gates behind `OperatorSemantics`. The first
  larger slice covers comparison transforms/laws, cardinality thresholds, static
  index-membership thresholds, and Python source `in` membership exact-safety.
  A later source-fact slice preserves selected JS/TS and Python equality-like
  source operators, but broader operator dispatch, overload semantics, and
  pack-facing consumers remain open.
- Continue migrating compatibility storage onto `EvidenceRecord` consumers.
  Source-origin, parameter-domain, import identity, symbol identity, guard,
  selected place/effect, selected library API occurrence, and selected
  sequence-surface consumers now use evidence-only proof paths where covered.
  Remaining mirror work is concentrated in broader lowered sequence/tag surfaces
  and unmodeled module/export dependencies rather than source/domain side tables.
- Add scope, dependency, and ambiguity validation for evidence records before
  they become a stable external extension surface.
- Expand the exact fragment facade from first-party helper functions into
  versioned pack-facing effect/place evidence records. The first substrate now
  covers canonical append calls, C/Go/Java non-overloadable index writes, and
  Java self-receiver/self-field writes through required `Effect`/`Place`
  evidence, including normalize refreshes after canonical rewrites.
- Continue replacing remaining local exact-fragment proof helpers with
  versioned pack-facing evidence records, especially broader field/read/write
  place facts, receiver-sensitive mutation/effect proofs, and mutation
  invalidation evidence shared with binding/import safety.
- Continue moving library API recognition into `LibraryApiContract` rows and
  `LibraryApi` occurrence evidence. The already producer-covered occurrence
  surfaces are now fail-closed on missing evidence; remaining work is promise
  receiver proof, explicit async/sync and Go channel protocol convergence
  contracts, richer Python/Ruby/Java/Rust iterator materialization/demand
  contracts, and ecosystem APIs whose receiver/domain/demand obligations are not
  yet expressible.
  The first internal slice covers collection/map factories, selected
  constructors, Java empty collection constructors, Java `Map.entry`, and the
  shared shadow/import/result
  obligations consumed by normalize and strict exact gates. The next slice moved
  selected non-factory surfaces behind the same identity/result facade: map-key
  views and wrappers, map `get`, map defaulting method calls, static JS-like
  helpers, regex-literal `.test`, Python `math.prod`, promise `.then`, iterator
  identity adapters, Java `Arrays.stream`, and existing language-scoped method
  call contracts. Occurrence-evidence slices now cover selected JS-like
  static/global APIs, Python builtin/import-backed factories/functions, Rust
  free-name/path factories, Ruby require-backed factories, Java `java.util`
  static factories/adapters and selected empty constructors, JS regex literals,
  JS/TS static-index membership, JS/TS/Java property builtins, Rust
  Option/scalar APIs, and selected receiver-method families.
  Remaining stdlib and ecosystem APIs still need dependency-backed occurrence
  records before they become pack-facing. Producer-covered
  factory/API result calls now also emit dependent call-node `Domain` evidence
  when the current `DomainEvidence` vocabulary can represent the result.
- Keep value-graph and strict exact gates on the same contract source. Factory,
  constructor, and selected method/view/adapter gates now share
  `LibraryApiContract` identity/result rows, and selected JS-like,
  Python builtin/import-backed, Rust free-name/path, Ruby require-backed, Java
  `java.util`, and regex calls now additionally share `LibraryApi` occurrence
  evidence, as do generic Python/Go free-function builtins and selected
  receiver-method families. Lowered sequence-surface consumers are now
  evidence-only where covered. Remaining API work is promise receiver proof,
  explicit async/sync protocol convergence contracts, and ecosystem APIs only
  after demand, receiver, and effect obligations are expressible.
- Continue import/module proof migration beyond the removed raw import payloads
  and evidence-only import identity path. Value-graph import identity and
  imported-symbol exact proof are now evidence-only, imported literal replacement
  copies provider evidence, and selected JS/TS `QualifiedGlobal` paths are
  covered, but general qualified-member resolution, namespace export identity,
  provider/export dependency manifests, richer scope/rebinding facts, and
  manifest-level cross-module dependency evidence are not.
- Generalize dedicated guard evidence beyond the first JS/TS record-shape and
  own-property contracts, including richer source-clause records, API dependency
  validation, subject/place identity, and truthiness/null semantics.
- Expand the first `SequenceSurface` evidence into richer sequence/aggregate
  records for factories, more nested entries, iterator views, and
  exported-literal eligibility. Current exact/value-graph consumers are
  evidence-only for covered lowered surfaces, but richer aggregate semantics
  still need versioned records beyond the first tag-kind vocabulary.
- Continue expanding domain evidence beyond parameter annotations. The shared
  receiver-domain consumer contract now accepts exact node-anchored receiver
  facts, binding-anchored immutable local/module facts, and selected admitted
  library/API factory result facts. Remaining work is broader inferred receiver
  domains, Java constructor call-domain evidence if that lowering stops
  collapsing directly to sequence surfaces, first-class mutation/effect evidence
  beyond the current first-party binding scan, and protocol-specific receiver
  facts that include demand/effect obligations.
- Turn named value-graph rule modules into LawPack-facing law ids/contracts while
  retaining formal-obligation metadata as the first-party proof boundary. The
  first `ValueLaw` contract surface now covers current arithmetic/boolean
  domain gates, but reduction laws, parity/toggle laws, low-level byte-pack
  laws, and ecosystem law packs remain local first-party code.
- Add receiver/place facts so field read/write and property contracts are not
  field-name-only.
- Add provenance fields internally before exposing them in scan JSON.

## Phase 3: first-party packs

- Convert Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java, C, Ruby, and embedded
  JS/TS containers into first-party compiled packs.
- Split stdlib knowledge into first-party `StdlibPack`s.
- Define conformance manifests for each pack: positive convergence cases, hard
  negatives, Raw coverage expectations, oracle coverage, and proof obligations.
- Ensure existing docs and capabilities are generated from or checked against pack
  metadata.

## Phase 4: external pack contract

- Define a versioned pack manifest schema.
- Start with data-only external packs for simple APIs.
- Add restricted recognizer hooks only after the manifest path is stable.
- Require pack metadata: provider, license, version range, supported analysis
  channels, evidence status, conformance commands, and semantic provenance ids.
- Document the pack conformance checklist as part of the extension schema; make
  clear that conformance evidence is provider/user responsibility unless the pack
  is first-party.
- Add user configuration for enabling external packs explicitly.
- Report which external packs influenced `near` candidates and exact matches.

The external schema must make proof obligations first-class. For example, a pack
claiming `pkg.Foo.map` maps to the `Map` protocol must say how `pkg.Foo` is
resolved, which versions it covers, how callback demand works, whether effects
are delayed or eager, and which hard negatives distinguish it from same-named but
different APIs.

## Phase 5: demand-aware semantics

- Model child demand: always, never, conditional, per-element pull,
  short-circuit-until, maybe repeated, and call-by-need memoized.
- Model effect visibility under demand: skipped effects, delayed effects,
  per-element callback effects, async scheduling, yields, and stream emissions.
- Refactor oracle and value graph to consume demand rules instead of local
  hard-coded evaluation behavior.
- Keep expanding lazy iterator/generator/channel hard negatives before enabling
  new exact laws. The first Python generator/list/set and Go channel/goroutine
  hard negatives are now in place, but the shared demand/effect abstraction is
  still future work.

## Phase 6: ecosystem packs

- Add high-value first-party packs only when their contracts are narrow and
  testable.
- Keep community packs external and opt-in unless nose explicitly adopts them as
  first-party/default packs with project-owned gates.
- Candidate areas: Lodash, RxJS, NumPy, pandas, Java Streams/Guava, Rust Iterator
  ecosystem helpers, Tokio futures, Rails ActiveSupport collection helpers.
- Keep exact eligibility narrow. Many APIs should stay `near-only` because
  versioning, mutability, callback effects, or dynamic dispatch make exact
  equivalence too risky.

## Open questions

- How much of a pack should be data-only, and when is a restricted recognizer hook
  justified?
- Should external recognizers run as compiled Rust, WASM, or a sandboxed DSL?
- What is the minimum provenance that scan JSON must expose without making reports
  noisy?
- How should users pin pack versions in CI?
- How should conflicting packs or overlapping API contracts be resolved?
- What conformance score is enough for a first-party pack to enter the default
  exact channel?
- Should a pack be able to express language-specific proof-producing lowering
  extensions before the general construct/import/type fact model is complete?

## Foundation acceptance status

The first implementation slice landed through PR #100 and PR #101. It is
considered successful because it:

- introduced the semantic-kernel vocabulary and first compiled facade;
- replaced multiple proof-sensitive `Lang`/name matches with named semantic
  predicates or fail-closed contracts;
- recorded intentional old-behavior changes where missing evidence blocks exact
  convergence;
- kept tests and docs checks green after the proof-gated scan follow-up;
- documented the first-party/external responsibility boundary;
- made accepted exact matches easier to explain through explicit contracts and
  hard-negative tests.

The next implementation slices should be judged by whether they remove another
class of scattered semantic knowledge without widening exact acceptance beyond
the available evidence.
