# Usage

The complete command and flag reference for `nose`. New here? Start with
[getting-started](getting-started.md) — it walks through a first run and how to
read the report. For settings you'd commit to a repo see
[configuration](configuration.md); for CI use see
[continuous integration](continuous-integration.md).

Throughout, **IL** is nose's *intermediate language*: every source language is lowered into
one normalized representation, so clones match within and across languages, and unit sizes are
measured in IL tokens (its node count). See [architecture](architecture.md) for the pipeline.

## Install

The quickest install (Homebrew or the install script) is in
[getting-started](getting-started.md#install). Prebuilt binaries for macOS (Apple
Silicon + Intel) and Linux (x86_64 + arm64) are attached to every
[release](https://github.com/corca-ai/nose/releases). To build from source:

```sh
cargo build --release
# binary at ./target/release/nose
```

nose is a single self-contained binary — no runtime, services, or network; point
it at source files. The examples below write `nose`, which works the same as a
from-source `./target/release/nose`.

`nose query` is the main command; the **Ranking** and **Detection modes** sections below
document the ranking keys and detection channels it uses.

## `nose query`

`nose query <path> [terms…]` analyzes a file or directory and prints the duplication
families nose found. With no terms it shows a summary: analysis scope, family counts by
evidence, the best candidates to inspect first, verified-evidence families, duplicated
directory hotspots, and next commands. Add terms to filter, group, sort, or open one
family; every result includes a runnable `nose query …` command.

To analyze disjoint trees in one run, pass every root explicitly:
`nose query --root packages --root scripts [terms…]` (short: `-r`). When
`--root`/`-r` is present, bare arguments are query terms; use `-r` for each
analyzed path.

`nose query` carries the analysis flags, the `--fail-on` CI gate, and a structured contract: with
`--format json` every view emits the versioned [query-JSON v3 contract](query-json.md), and
`--format markdown`/`sarif` produce a ranked report.

```text
nose query <path> [FILTER … | group=FIELD | id=FAM | at=FILE:LINE | reinvented | base=REF] [since=FILE] [sort=KEY] [top=N] [full] [all]
nose query --root <path> --root <path> [FILTER … | group=FIELD | id=FAM | at=FILE:LINE | reinvented | base=REF] …
```

| part | meaning |
|---|---|
| `field=value` | keep families where the field equals the value (terms AND-ed); `field>N`/`field<N` for numbers; `path~substr` for a path substring; **set OR** with a comma — `witness=exact,shared-core` matches either; **negate** with `field!=value` / `path!~substr` (e.g. `path!~frontend` drops a directory; `witness!=exact,shared-core` drops both) |
| `group=FIELD` | facet the selection by a discrete field (`dir`, `file`, `scope`, `witness`, `lang`, `shape`, `same_symbol`, `spotclass`, `status`); each bucket carries its family count **and summed removable lines**, ranked by removable — so `group=dir`/`group=file` is the duplication **hotspot** map |
| `id=FAM` | open one family (any unambiguous id prefix): its copies, the all-copies extraction skeleton, overlapping-family links (`subsumes`/`subsumed_by`), and navigation |
| `at=FILE:LINE` | open the family whose copy covers that source location — a stable handle across edits (the span-derived `id=` shifts when code moves) |
| `reinvented` | the **reinvented-helper** view: code that reimplements an existing helper inline (the action is "call it"). Production findings are shown only when the helper is also production code; matches that point production code at a test-only helper are omitted with a count, because the safe action is to rehome/extract a production helper first. Complements `shape=call-existing-helper` (those are the cases the family clusterer caught; these are the ones it did not) |
| `base=REF` | the **divergent-edit** view: detect families at the git ref, flag the ones a diff changed in one copy but not its siblings — a likely un-propagated fix. It is its own view, so combine it only with `top=N`, detection flags, `--format`, or `--fail-on any`; ordinary family filters are for the non-`base=` query views. Each item carries `fire_eligible` (the conservative proven-shared-logic verdict); `base=REF --fail-on any` is the CI gate (fires only on the proven case) |
| `since=FILE` | compare to a saved snapshot (written with `--baseline FILE --write-baseline`) and expose each family's **`status`** (`new`/`changed`/`unchanged`) as a queryable field — the temporal lens. Hides nothing (unlike `--baseline`); `since=B status=new --fail-on any` is the composable gate |
| `sort=KEY` | `extractability` (default), `value`, `members` (also `sites` and the experimental `hazard` — see [Ranking](#ranking)) |
| `top=N` | show the first N rows (default 30); `top=0` shows **all** |
| `full` | on `id=` or a list, render the all-copies extraction skeletons inline (batched); each varying spot is `⟨param N: class⟩` — a coarse value-class hint (`literal`/`name`/`call`/`expr`/`block`) for the helper signature |
| `all` | widen past the curated default surface to the full raw universe (demoted families labeled) |

Fields: `scope` (prod\|test\|mixed), `witness` (exact\|shared-core\|copy-paste\|similar —
`shared-core` is spelled `subdag` in `--format json`; both are accepted as filter values),
`same_symbol` (true\|false — every copy is the same named symbol, the parallel-variant
signature), `spotclass` (leaf-only\|structural — for near families, whether the varying spots
are clean value-leaves to parameterize or genuine logic divergence; non-near families group
as `unwitnessed` under `group=spotclass`, which is not itself a filterable value), `status`
(new\|changed\|unchanged — vs the `since=` snapshot), `lang`, `path`, `dir`,
`members`, `files`, `value`, `params`, `shared`. Every row shows the payoff economics —
`M/REP shared, Pp · ~N removable` — so a candidate can be triaged without opening it. Each
result is a pure function of (repo state, command); an unknown field or enum value is a hard
error (so a typo can't read as "no duplication").

`spotclass` reads the [graded witness](graded-witness.md), which is presentation-layer
enrichment (the dominant extra analysis cost), so `query` computes it **on demand** — only when a term
filters or groups by `spotclass`. The common query path pays nothing; a `spotclass=` /
`group=spotclass` query re-derives the witness for the near families first.

A typical loop: `nose query .` → `nose query . witness=exact` → `nose query . id=<id> full`.

`nose query` accepts the same **analysis flags** as the detection pipeline — `--mode`
(see [Detection modes](#detection-modes)), `--min-size`, `--min-value`, `--min-members`, `--exclude`,
`--cache-dir`, `--ignore-file`, `--semantic-pack`, `--config` — so the dataset it explores is
configured by flag while scope/sort/top are the DSL's `scope=`/`sort=`/`top=`. It also takes the
**CI gate** — `--fail-on any` / `--fail-on new` with `--baseline`/`--write-baseline` — and
drops structured-ignored families. The gate follows the untruncated family selection addressed
by the query terms (`top=N` only limits display), so `nose query <path> path~api --fail-on any`
fails only on reportable `path~api` families. See [continuous-integration](continuous-integration.md).
The `base=` view is the exception: it reuses only detection flags (`--mode`, `--min-size`,
advanced `--min-lines`, `--exclude`, `--config`), `--ignore-file`, `--format`, `top=N`, and
`--fail-on any`; report-shaping and baseline flags are rejected instead of ignored.

A named path that doesn't exist is an error (exit non-zero) — a typo'd path in a
CI gate must fail loudly. A path that exists but contains no supported source
files warns on stderr and reports an empty result. This holds for `nose query` and
`nose stats`.

How to read the resulting dashboard — the scope line, the confidence breakdown,
the per-family economics, scope tags, and the `→` hint — is covered in
[getting-started → How to read the report](getting-started.md#how-to-read-the-report).

### The default surface

The dashboard, the other formats, and the `--fail-on` gate show a curated **default
surface** of action-oriented families, and hold the rest back behind a one-line omission
footer (`omitted N families …`). Held back are tiny proof-only fragments,
fragments, generated/distributed-output families (including generated-code headers and CSS
source-plus-compiled/minified build pipelines), **declaration runs**
(spans that are only import/include/use/re-export lines — duplication the language mandates
per file, with nothing to extract), and **shallow-extraction** families (a helper that would
be mostly parameters — `params` ≥ a third of the shared lines). Add `all` to widen the view
to the full raw universe, each demoted family labeled with why it was held back. This curated
surface is what `--fail-on` gates on — a family in the `all` view alone never fails a run.

## Ranking

`sort=` chooses what "most worth your attention first" means.
`--min-value` is a noise floor on raw value and applies under every sort. `nose query`
accepts `extractability`, `value`, `sites`, the alias `members`, and the experimental `hazard`.
(The query dashboard's
`sort` cheatsheet advertises only the common three — `extractability`, `value`, `members`.)

| key | ranks by | use when |
|---|---|---|
| `extractability` *(default)* | invariant (shared) lines × copies × spread, weighted by tightness (shared/total) and penalized by parameter count and by member-span heterogeneity (copies of unlike length aren't one shape). Cross-language families have no comparable source lines, so they fall back to semantic repeated volume and display as `cross-language · ~N repeated` instead of `~N removable`. | you want the duplication that folds *cleanly* into one helper — not the biggest block that merely looks similar |
| `value` | raw duplicated volume: duplicated lines (mean span × copies) × similarity × spread — ranks by repeated *volume*, not the `removable` field (a structural Type-4 family can rank high here yet show `removable=0` when no literal lines survive all copies) | you want the most *code* deleted, accepting that divergent copies cost more to merge |
| `sites` / `members` | number of copies | hunting the most-repeated patterns |
| `hazard` *(experimental)* | divergent-edit *propensity*: line span × spread × invisibility × scope | you want a view of which clones tend to get edited inconsistently — **not yet a validated *harm* ranker** (see [hazard-ranking](hazard-ranking.md)) |

Extractability is the default because raw volume over-rewards a large block whose
copies share little: a 384-line family that shares only 22 lines across 14 varying
spots is mostly scaffolding (6% invariant), not an extraction — it ranks far below a
tight `15/15`-shared, zero-parameter pair. The honest `N/M shared · Pp` cell in the
report is the same signal the ranking uses. Same-language families with **no** shared
invariant lines (a language idiom, or two unrelated type literals with the same shape)
have nothing to extract and sink to the bottom, even at `sim 1.00`. Extractability also
demotes families whose copies **vary widely in length**: 25 same-shaped-but-different
`Serializer` methods are not one helper waiting to happen, however many copies there
are — a measured proxy for signature heterogeneity (see [experiments](experiments.md)).
For cross-language families, source-line overlap is not meaningful; the row says
`cross-language · ~N repeated`, and query JSON marks `source_comparable: false`.

`--sort hazard` is an **experimental** severity-style ranking calibrated on mined
divergent-edit history. It predicts *which clones get edited inconsistently* (divergence
propensity) but, per a gold-label audit, **does not yet rank actual *harm* better than
chance** — see [hazard-ranking](hazard-ranking.md) for the full, honest evaluation.

## Detection modes

nose's detection has three stable orthogonal channels, selected with `--mode` on
`nose query`. Omitting `--mode` runs all three:
`syntax,semantic,near`. When `--mode` is present, nose runs exactly the channels you list;
it does not add them to the default. See [clone-types](clone-types.md) for what each finds
against the standard Type-1–4 taxonomy.

| mode | clone type | detector channel | use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `syntax` | Type-1 / exact token-run floor | same-language jscpd-style contiguous copy-paste runs | replacing jscpd / blocking copy-paste clones in CI |
| `semantic` | Type-4 | exact value-fingerprint matches | high-confidence semantic clones with no fuzzy threshold |
| `near` | Type-3 | shape candidates + fuzzy structural/value scoring | finding near-duplicates for triage |

Examples:

```sh
nose query src                                  # syntax + semantic + near (the default)
nose query src --mode syntax --fail-on any      # jscpd-style gate
nose query src --mode semantic                  # exact Type-4 only
nose query src --mode near:0.70                 # Type-3 only
nose query src --mode syntax,semantic           # exact channels only, no fuzzy near
nose query src --mode syntax --mode semantic    # same as --mode syntax,semantic
```

The `near` channel takes its acceptance threshold inline — `--mode near:0.8` (default
`0.70`). `syntax` and `semantic` are exact channels and take no threshold.

There is also a hidden experimental `abstraction[:T]` mode. It reuses the `near`
candidate stream, defaults to threshold `0.50`, and then keeps only same-language
families whose normalized IL differs by exactly one supported literal leaf. Its
claim is weaker than `semantic`: it reports a refactoring-template witness with a
typed hole and caveats such as `numeric-domain-sensitive`; it does not say the two
copies are behavior-equivalent. Emit all families as JSON (`nose query … top=0 --format json`)
to consume the `abstraction_witness` field.
The witness is built from normalized IL, not line-level `--show proposal` text; its
template is machine-oriented today and carries typed hole metadata for tooling. A
reported abstraction family must share one literal-leaf hole position across all
members; mixed families with different changed positions are left unwitnessed.
When `near:T` and `abstraction:T` are combined in one run, they share one fuzzy
acceptance threshold; giving different inline values is rejected instead of silently
choosing the last one.

The `syntax` channel is the CPD floor: it finds same-language duplicated token runs even
when they start or end in the middle of a function. The normalized unit channels
(`semantic` and `near`) are where renamed identifiers, literal-varied Type-2 cases,
cross-language convergence, and Type-3 edits are handled.

`semantic` is still unit-bounded rather than an arbitrary-fragment equivalence search.
Besides whole functions/classes/blocks, it admits only exact-safe sub-function fragments
whose inputs, exits, and ordered effects are self-contained: direct return/throw values,
bounded conditional guards, selected for-each append/index effects, and fixed-`this` Java
field writes. General statement windows, dynamic receiver writes, mixed unproven effects,
and arbitrary field/property mutation stay closed. The exact fragment contract is
documented in [fragment-contracts](fragment-contracts.md).

### Flags

Grouped by what they do. Config-backed defaults are listed in
[configuration](configuration.md); workflow and output flags stay CLI-only. The ranking and
mode flags are documented under [Ranking](#ranking) and [Detection modes](#detection-modes) above.

**Filter & shape the report**

| flag | effect |
|---|---|
| `--min-members N` | only families with at least N duplicated sites (default 2) |
| `--min-value V` | hide families below this finite non-negative refactoring value (noise floor on large repos) |
| `--min-size N` | ignore units or syntax copy-paste runs smaller than this size, in IL tokens (default 24) |
| `--mode MODE` | one or more of `syntax`, `semantic`, `near[:T]`; comma-list or repeatable; when present, replaces the default. Experimental `abstraction[:T]` is accepted but not a stable capabilities mode. |
| `--root <path>` / `-r <path>` | analyze another root; repeat for multi-root query runs. With `--root`, bare positional arguments are query terms. |
| `--exclude <glob>` | skip paths matching a gitignore-syntax glob (repeatable) |
| `--ignore-file <file>` | suppress accepted families using a structured ignore file with reason/owner/expiry metadata |
| `--semantic-pack <file-or-dir>` | explicitly load local semantic-pack v0 manifest metadata for provenance reporting; external packs are metadata-only today |

**Output**

| flag | effect |
|---|---|
| `--format human\|json\|markdown\|sarif` | output format (default `human`) |

Use terms for report shaping: `sort=KEY`, `top=N`, `scope=prod|test|mixed`, `group=dir`,
`id=<fam> full`, and `reinvented`. `--format json` emits the stable
[query-json](query-json.md) contract.

**Workflow** (`--baseline`, `--write-baseline`, `--fail-on any|new`, `--ignore-file`, `--cache-dir`, `--config`, `--semantic-pack`) is covered in
[continuous-integration](continuous-integration.md), [configuration](configuration.md), and
[semantic-pack-loading](semantic-pack-loading.md).
Structured suppressions are covered in [structured-ignores](structured-ignores.md).

## Integrating with nose

Use `nose capabilities` when another tool needs to decide what this installed
binary supports before it invokes a query:

```sh
nose capabilities
```

The command emits JSON only. It reports the tool version, platform, stable
commands, supported detection modes and output formats such as SARIF, JSON schema
versions, config keys, and query capability flags such as baselines, caching,
and structured ignores. Do not scrape `nose --help`; help text is for humans
and may change to improve readability. The stable contract is documented in
[capabilities](capabilities.md); the structured result JSON is in
[query-json](query-json.md).

## Other commands

- `nose query <paths> base=<ref>` — flags clones changed inconsistently in a diff
  (a copy edited, its siblings missed); use `base=HEAD` for uncommitted changes and
  `base=origin/main` for a PR branch. Full guide in [divergent edits](divergent-edits.md).
- `nose stats <paths…> [--top N] [--format human|json]` — per-language IL lowering coverage (the
  Raw-node ratio, split into by-design protocol boundaries vs genuine lowering gaps), with
  the top unhandled surface kinds (`--top`, default 30; `--format json` for machine output —
  the same `--format` contract as `query`/`il`).
  Use it to spot a language/construct that isn't lowering well; see [languages](languages.md).
- `nose semantic-pack check <file-or-dir> [--format human|json]` — validate local
  semantic-pack v0 manifest structure and declared fixture assets. It is a
  pack-author/user workflow, not external pack certification; see
  [semantic-pack-conformance](semantic-pack-conformance.md).
- `nose il <file> [--normalized] [--no-cfg-norm] [--format sexpr|json]` — dump the IL
  for one file (`--normalized` shows the canonical form after the
  [normalization](normalization.md) passes). A debugging tool for understanding why two
  snippets do or don't converge; see [architecture](architecture.md).

Hidden `behavioral-gate`, `detect`, `verify`, `features`, `eval`, and `ceiling` commands
exist for strict/research workflows — an experimental Type-4 benchmark harness and oracle
tooling, not stable integration surfaces; do not build automation around them without
checking the current binary. They are hidden from `--help` because `query` is the command
for everyday use; the [benchmark](benchmark.md) page documents them.
