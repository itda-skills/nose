# Architecture

nose lowers every language into one normalized intermediate language (IL),
designed so that semantically-equivalent code converges toward identical
structure, then finds and ranks duplication on top of it. The IL is **not** the
deliverable — it's the substrate. Back to [home](home.md).

## North star

nose's exact Type-4 goal is **not** to guess arbitrary semantic similarity. It is
to become the strongest detector for the semantic equivalence classes it explicitly
models: broad cross-language coverage, exact fingerprint equality, and a defensible
soundness contract for every accepted semantic match.

That means recall work should raise more real equivalences to exact convergence
rather than lowering thresholds around partial similarity. A new semantic match is
only a durable win when it can be backed by the independent interpreter oracle,
counterexamples for rejected rewrites, and, for core canonicalizations, machine-checked
proofs. False merges are product bugs; fuzziness belongs in candidate generation and
review-oriented `near` scoring, not in the exact `semantic` channel.

## The pipeline

```
source ──tree-sitter──▶ raw IL ──normalize──▶ canonical IL ──▶ units + features
                                                                      │
                                       MinHash + LSH candidate gen ◀──┘
                                                  │
                          structural + value-graph scoring ──▶ clusters ──▶ ranked families
```

1. **Lower** ([languages](languages.md)): tree-sitter parses each file; a per-language pass
   walks the CST and emits raw IL using a small, desugared core node set. Every
   node copies its source span, so every match traces back to exact lines.
   Frontends also tag syntactic unit boundaries (function/method/class/block),
   which gives detection accurate boundaries for free.
2. **Normalize** ([normalization](normalization.md)): a fixed sequence of passes canonicalizes
   the IL — desugaring (with idiom canonicalization), alpha-renaming, dataflow propagation,
   control-flow normalization, algebraic and operator canonicalization, and a hash-consed
   **value graph** (GVN) that captures *what the code computes*, invariant to temporaries,
   statement order, and common subexpressions. See [normalization](normalization.md) for the
   exact pass order.
3. **Extract units & features**: frontend units are augmented with bounded
   sub-function units: control-flow blocks (`loop` / statement `if` / `try`) and
   exact-safe statement fragments whose whole value subtree stays inside the reported
   source span. Exact fragments carry a first-class classification, contract, and
   behavior oracle — see [fragment-contracts](fragment-contracts.md). Each unit becomes a
   multiset of subtree-shape hashes, a value-graph fingerprint, a pre-order linearization
   for alignment, a MinHash signature, plus literal- and return-value multisets used by
   the strict precision gates.
4. **Candidate generation**: the selected scan channels decide which candidates exist.
   `semantic` uses value-fingerprint MinHash signatures, `near` uses shape MinHash
   signatures, and `syntax` bypasses unit LSH with a Rabin-Karp token-stream pass.
5. **Accept / score**: `semantic` accepts exact value-fingerprint equality, `near`
   scores candidates with structural alignment (RANSAC) plus weighted shape/value
   Jaccard and accepts above `--threshold`, and `syntax` emits duplicated runs above
   the line/token floors.
6. **Cluster & rank**: union-find over accepted pairs/runs forms clone groups, which
   are grouped into **families** and sorted by refactoring value (removable lines
   × similarity × cross-module/-file/-language spread). See [usage](usage.md) for how the
   ranked report reads.

## Crates

A Cargo workspace; data flows left-to-right through them.

| crate | role |
|---|---|
| `nose-il` | arena IL model (`Vec<Node>`, `NodeId(u32)`, out-of-line edges), provenance spans, interner, serialization, IR verifier |
| `nose-frontend` | tree-sitter parse + per-language CST→IL lowering (one module per language; embedded `<script>` extraction) |
| `nose-normalize` | the normalization passes + the value graph (GVN) |
| `nose-detect` | unit/feature extraction, MinHash/LSH, scoring, clustering, refactor ranking |
| `nose-eval` | benchmark scoring (precision/recall, pooled, stratified) — see [benchmark](benchmark.md) |
| `nose-cli` | the `nose` binary, config loading, baselines, caching |

## Design choices worth knowing

- **Arena, not boxed trees.** The IL is a flat `Vec<Node>` with `NodeId(u32)`
  indices and out-of-line child edges — cache-friendly and cheap to serialize,
  which is what makes per-file feature caching ([continuous-integration](continuous-integration.md))
  possible.
- **Interner-independent features.** A unit's features are content-derived
  hashes, not interner ids, so they're portable across runs — the basis for the
  content-hash cache.
- **Determinism is a hard invariant.** Output is byte-identical across runs *and*
  thread counts. File ids come from a sorted path list; nothing iterates a
  `HashMap` into the output. There are tests for both.
- **Parallel by default.** Discovery, lowering, and the detection stages run
  under rayon; the LSH stage is sort-based so it parallelizes cleanly. See
  [experiments](experiments.md) §T for the throughput work.
- **The behavioral fingerprint is sound by intent.** The value graph's contract
  (§AJ) is *fingerprint-equal ⟹ behavior-equal* — two units sharing a value-graph
  fingerprint must compute the same thing; a *false merge* is a bug, not an accepted
  approximation. Two mechanisms enforce it. (1) A tree-walking **interpreter oracle**
  (`nose verify`) runs every interpretable unit on a battery of inputs and flags any
  fingerprint-equal pair whose behavior differs. Crucially it interprets the
  *pre-canonicalization* core IL, not the fully-normalized IL it fingerprints, so a
  behavior-changing canonicalization cannot mask itself (§AX). (2) A **canon-preservation**
  check requires each unit's core-IL behavior to equal its full-IL behavior — catching a
  bad canon even with no colliding twin. The core algebraic/control canonicalizations are
  additionally **machine-checked in Lean** (`formal/`). Both checks currently report zero
  violations; the fuzziness a clone detector needs lives in the *candidate* axis and its
  scoring, never in the behavioral base (the two-axis principle, §AH).

For *why* the normalization passes look the way they do, read [normalization](normalization.md).
