# Exact fragment contracts

How nose models **exact sub-function semantic fragments** — the return/throw/effect
shapes it lifts out of larger function bodies — as a shared substrate rather than an
accumulating set of ad-hoc predicates. Back to [architecture](architecture.md); the
benchmark that drives the frontier is [type4-benchmark](type4-benchmark.md).

## Why a substrate

A whole function is the natural unit, but many real Type-4 clones are a *region* inside a
larger body: a guarded `return`, an append loop, a `this.field` write. nose extracts these
as **exact fragments** (see the extract step in [architecture](architecture.md)) under a
hard rule — a fragment is admitted only when its behavior is self-contained and provable,
so opaque surrounding code can never smuggle in unproven semantics.

Historically each admissible shape was a standalone boolean predicate in
`nose-detect/src/units.rs`. That found sound cases but trended toward a case matrix: the
*reason* a fragment was accepted lived only in whichever predicate matched it, and nothing
verified a fragment's behavior the way [`nose verify`](architecture.md) verifies whole
functions. The substrate replaces the implicit predicate web with three explicit pieces.

## The three pieces

### 1. Classification — `FragmentKind`

Every accepted fragment carries a `FragmentKind` (direct return/throw, index-assign effect,
self-field assign, expression effect, conditional guard, loop effect, self-field body) and a
stable kebab-case **reason code** (`exact-direct-return`, `exact-loop-effect`, …). The reason
code names the exact proof shape that made the fragment safe; it is not the broader
family/actionability reason code tracked in issue #11. Reporting and ranking can separate
proof fragments from actionable refactors without re-reading the recognizer. The recognizer
returns a `FragmentKind` instead of a bare `bool`; `ProofFacts` records what was established
at acceptance time (context-safety, exit).

### 2. The contract — `FragmentContract`

A recognizer-independent description of one fragment: its free **inputs** (the canonical ids
it reads), its **exit** (normal / return / throw), and its **effects** — an *ordered sequence*
of observable effects, each paired with the write **place** for the receiver-bearing ones. The
sequence is empty for a pure value/control sink (a direct return/throw), one entry for a
single-statement write, and several — in execution order — for a multi-statement body (a
conditional branch, a loop body, an ordered effect sequence). Two fragments with the same
contract are interchangeable to the oracle regardless of which predicate matched them.

The contract carries only what the oracle needs to build a runnable wrapper. That is the
forcing function: **a contract that cannot be lowered into a wrapper is underspecified**, so
the model cannot drift into describing fragments the oracle can't vouch for. The
`writes_proven` check is the fail-closed gate over the effect sequence: every field write must
resolve to a proven [`Place`] (an append/index write carries no such obligation).

### 3. The oracle — wrapper synthesis

A fragment is verified through the *same* independent behavior check as a whole function. We
do **not** add a new interpreter path. Instead the contract is lowered into a synthetic
single-function IL — free inputs become parameters, the fragment subtree is deep-copied into
the body — and handed to the existing [`run_unit`](architecture.md) interpreter. We reuse
its `Behavior` (returned value + ordered effect trace + final field state) and the same input
battery whole functions use.

Because `Behavior` already records effects and field state, **effects are preserved as
observable behavior for free**: appending to a parameter list shows up in the effect trace,
so two append fragments that append different values diverge without any special handling. A
multi-statement body is lowered by splicing its statements into the wrapper body in order, so
an ordered effect sequence (e.g. two appends) is observed in order — swapping them diverges.

The wrapper's parameters are the fragment's **free inputs**, computed binding-aware: a cid
read from the enclosing scope is an input, but one *bound within* the fragment — a local
assigned before use, a `for-each` loop variable, a nested lambda parameter — is not, because
the interpreter binds it as the wrapper runs. (The binding model mirrors alpha-renaming's.)
This is what lets loop- and temp-bearing bodies be modeled at all: treating a loop variable as
a parameter would inflate the arity and feed it a battery value the loop immediately
overwrites. Omitting a genuine input only ever under-reports — an unbound read makes the
wrapper uninterpretable (fail-closed), never a false merge.

## The effect algebra

The substrate names *how* each effect is observed, because that determines its soundness
obligation — it does not treat every mutation as append-like:

| effect | observed as | receiver identity |
|---|---|---|
| `Append` | ordered effect trace (the appended values, in order) | not required |
| `IndexWrite` | ordered effect trace (key then value) | not required |
| `FieldWrite` | field-state map, keyed by **field name only** | **required (proven place)** |
| `Other` | established by running the fragment | — |

A field write is the one case where the interpreter does **not** observe the receiver (the
field-state map is keyed by name), so a field write is exact-safe only when its receiver is a
proven place. This is exactly why a fixed `this` is the only admitted field receiver — not a
special case, but a consequence of the algebra.

## Place — receiver identity, fail-closed

A receiver-bearing write resolves its target to a `Place`: `This`, `Param(cid)`,
`LocalAlloc(id)`, a `Field` or `Index` path over another place, or `Unknown`. The cardinal
rule is that **`Unknown` is the default**: any receiver that does not resolve to a proven place
is `Unknown`, and a field write through an `Unknown` receiver is rejected, never merged. A
`Place` is recorded on the contract *only* for effects that need this proof — i.e. field
writes. An index write carries no place at all: it is observable in the effect trace (key and
value are recorded), so its receiver identity is irrelevant to soundness, and conflating its
target into the contract would mix proof with diagnostics.

This folds the former Java `this.field` special case into the general model: `this.x = v`
resolves to `Field(This, …)`, and the recognizer asserts the place is exact-safe.

## The differential gate

The recognizers are migrated onto the contract path one family at a time. An independent
contract recognizer (`fragment::recognize`) re-expresses each migrated shape, reusing only the
shared invalidation gates (span containment + context safety) rather than the per-shape
predicates. A test asserts that over a multi-language corpus the predicate path and the
contract path accept **exactly the same `(span, kind)` set** for migrated kinds, and a
`debug_assert` in the collector cross-checks the forward direction on every accepted fragment
across the whole fixture corpus. A migration step that changes which fragments are accepted
fails the gate — that is what keeps the re-expression behavior-invariant.

## Migrated kinds, and what remains

The predicate path in `units.rs` is still the **production authority**: it decides which
fragments are accepted. The contract path is an independent shadow recognizer, kept in lockstep
by the differential gate above. Migrating a kind means re-expressing it on the contract path
and adding it to that gate — it does **not** change production output.

| `FragmentKind` | contract-migrated? |
|---|---|
| `DirectReturn`, `DirectThrow` | yes — value/control sinks |
| `IndexAssignEffect`, `SelfFieldAssign`, `ExprEffect` | yes — single-effect writes |
| `ConditionalGuard` | not yet — predicate-owned |
| `LoopEffect` | not yet — predicate-owned |
| `SelfFieldBody` | not yet — predicate-owned |

The remaining three need substrate the migrated single-statement shapes did not: binding-aware
free inputs (loop variables, branch-local temps), an ordered multi-effect sequence, and
multi-statement wrapper lowering. Those capabilities are now in place (described above); the
kinds migrate onto them one at a time, each behind the differential gate, in follow-up work.
The interim "branch-local temp" and "ordered multi-effect" shapes are proof mechanisms *inside*
those three kinds, not new `FragmentKind` variants or reason codes.

## What stays closed

In keeping with the exact-semantic goal, the substrate does not open new ground by itself:

- no arbitrary statement windows — only shapes with explicit input/exit/effect contracts;
- no dynamic-receiver semantics inferred from method names;
- no overloadable operations or library-purity assumptions without proof facts;
- map/set/object-update effect families stay closed until the substrate proves them sound.

The point is a clear model that makes the *next* sound family cheap to add, not more
proof-fragment noise.
