# nose — experiment log

A **curated** record of what we tried and what we learned — distilled to the durable
findings, the shipped techniques, and the dead ends worth not re-walking. The full
blow-by-blow (every intermediate baseline and rejected parameter sweep) lives in git
history; this page keeps the lessons. Sections are lettered chronologically (A…BF);
other docs and code comments cite them as `§<letter>`, so the letters are stable anchors.
The methodology and headline numbers are summarized in [benchmark](benchmark.md); the passes
these experiments shaped are in [normalization](normalization.md) and [architecture](architecture.md).

The current user-facing `nose query` command has three channels (`syntax`, `semantic`,
`near`), described in [usage](usage.md); they share one lower → normalize → feature
pipeline, with exact semantic matches coming from the value graph.

## Measurement methodology

The early sections (A–T) measured against a 327-pair audited gold set
(`semantic_duplicates.v2`) with a **dev / held-out** repo split, line-span-IoU partial
credit, max-weight bipartite matching, repo-macro F1, and a hard-negative FP-rate, at a
**±0.019 macro-F1 noise floor** — deltas below it are not accepted. Reproduce with
`nose detect … --dump` then `nose eval` / `nose ceiling`. The target later moved twice
(§G to a strict Type-4 set, §W/§AU to the v5 refactoring-family labelset) as the goal
sharpened from "behavioral equivalence" to "refactoring-worthiness"; each move is noted
where it happens. Reference points at the start: a prior token-based baseline scored
~0.034/0.028 dev/held-out macro-F1; nose at that time scored 0.040/0.038.

---

## A. Adopted (in the main pipeline)

The shipped core, each validated by an equivalence fixture in `tests/equivalence.rs`:
tree-sitter frontends → one IL; coverage hardening (raw-node ratio 7.37% → <0.01%);
alpha-renaming; loop unification; idiom canonicalization; higher-order-function
unification; template ↔ concat; dataflow copy/expr propagation; the hash-consed value
graph (GVN) as the behavioral substrate; algebraic canonicalization (assoc/comm flatten,
De Morgan); control-flow normalization; LSH candidate generation at **k=128, b=32**.

### A2 — Determinism (symbol-content hashing)

Detection was nondeterministic (5099/5051/5066 predictions across identical runs) because
`ThreadedRodeo` assigns symbol ids in thread-race order. Fixed by hashing each symbol's
**string content** (`symbol_hash`, FNV-1a) rather than its interner id, so the
fingerprint is independent of arena order. Output is now byte-identical across runs,
thread counts, and machines.

## B. Measured on the gold set — what didn't move

LSH k=128/b=32 was the one adoption (candidate-reach 27% → 30%). Rejected or made
opt-in because they were within the noise floor or hurt precision: `b=64` (10.7M-pair
blowup), threshold lowering (F1 collapse), an atom-overlap scoring term (HN-FP up), DCE
(`--dce`, within noise), algebraic identity folding (byte-identical ⇒ zero effect), and a
coarse bag-of-operations channel (6× candidates, flat). Sub-function **blocks** were
opt-in here and judged FP-prone; that verdict was later overturned (§M) once the target
was fixed.

## C. Rejected idea *families* (the durable dead ends)

Three families that repeatedly fail, so don't rebuild them: (1) **threshold/parameter
tuning** — trades recall for precision on a shallow curve and collapses precision past a
point; (2) **coarse bag-of-operations features** — make divergent clones *surfaceable*
but not *separable*, so FP rises ≥1:1 with recall; (3) **cleanup normalization** (DCE,
algebraic identity folding) — real clones never differ this way, so **equality-saturation
/ an e-graph is not worth building** for cleanup (re-confirmed empirically in §BB).

## D. The recall funnel

Recall is lost in stages: gold → unit-extractable → candidate-reachable → scored. Early
on ~56% was lost at unit extraction and ~17% at candidate generation. The framing is
durable even as the numbers shift: the residual frontier is genuine algorithmic/structural
divergence (the undecidable Type-4 core), not a tuning problem.

## E. Cross-disciplinary candidate pipeline

A branch-per-idea protocol (clear the ±0.019 floor without a precision regression, else
drop) over ~20 ideas harvested from other fields (WL kernels, Smith-Waterman, NetSimile,
graph embeddings, ECFP/Morgan fingerprints, PDG slicing, Shazam hashing, BM25). A
nine-field sweep returned **1 merge / 8 drops**. The one win: **RANSAC consensus-offset
alignment** replacing the LCS scorer (held-out 0.0378 → 0.0489, HN-FP 0.103 → 0.077,
simpler and faster). Two lessons: candidate-widening is a dead family (recall is gated by
*scoring*, not generation), and **alignment selectivity is the lever** (selective RANSAC
helps, lenient DTW hurts).

## F. Non-exhaustive gold — LLM-as-judge pooling

A sparse gold set makes naive precision (~1%) meaningless. Fixed with pooling + a
calibrated LLM-judge oracle. The decisive finding: a **broad** "duplicate" definition
flags 95% of hard-negatives (ill-posed, non-separable), while a **strict** behavioral
Type-4 definition is crisp and separable but only ~20% of gold v2 meets it. Out-of-gold
real precision was ~6% (recall-corrected ~30%), not the naive 1%.

## G. Type-4-PURE benchmark — a benchmark-overturning finding

Strict-judging the full pool showed gold v2's `production_type4` label is **~95%
mislabeled** for behavioral Type-4: the pairs are same-skeleton/different-behavior siblings
a good detector *should reject* (`max >` vs `min <`, `parseFloat` vs `parseInt`). This
explains why nearly every prior experiment read "within-noise" — they optimized toward a
non-clone-laden target. **`typed4.v1` (65 strict positives), not gold v2, became the
target.**

## H. Judge reliability — a 3-persona panel, validated both ways

A prover/refuter/neutral panel (majority consensus) scored **0% false positives** across
all personas on 160 pairs, and the mislabel finding held (0% consensus on disputed
gold-type4). Judge *recall* was then validated on 18 hand-authored provably-equivalent
pairs → **100% consensus recall** (the two dissents were correct edge-case catches: NaN
identity, empty-array throw). Validated on both axes, the judge is a trustworthy oracle, so
`typed4.v1` and the §G overturn rest on solid ground. A detector floor-test (forced below
the size gate) showed a **tiny-function blind spot** — 13% recall, 60% cross-family false
merges — which is why `min_tokens=24` excludes that regime.

## J. Validated re-baseline + measurement stack

Rebuilt eval on the correct target with pool-aware precision and bootstrap CIs (`analyze.py`,
`synth.py`, one-command `bench.py`). Canonical baseline: type4 recall 0.589, pool-precision
0.059, AUC-PR 0.23, HN-FP 0.077. Three roadmap findings: the gap is **precision, not recall**
(AUC-PR 0.23 ≫ raw 0.06 ⇒ ranking is the top lever); nose was then a structural Type-2/3
matcher, not yet Type-4 (~6% transformation recall); normalization passes sat at noise on the
validated target.

## K. Semantic convergence + precision

The real Type-4 gap in production code is **async ↔ sync twins**, not loop ↔ reduce (which
barely occurs in real code). Adopted: async→sync name canonicalization (`__aexit__` →
`__exit__`) and small-int literal retention (`-2..=2` kept as value-keyed `LitInt`, since
`0` ≠ `1` is behavior). Rejected: a semantic floor `score = max(blend, vj)` — catastrophic,
predictions 3578 → 66,665. **Lesson: value-graph multiset-Jaccard is not precise enough as a
standalone acceptance criterion** (`vj ≥ 0.70` collides low-entropy small functions); it needs
precise semantic-key matching, not fuzzy similarity + a floor.

## L. Recall is extraction-bound — arrow-function units

Of 25 missed pairs, **19 were blocked at extraction**: the frontend only tagged
`function_declaration`/`method_definition`, so modern JS/TS `export const f = (…) => {…}`
lowered to an inline Lambda and never became a unit. Fix: a `const f = arrow/function-expr`
becomes a named `Func` unit (`lower_func_value`); inline callbacks stay Lambda. AUC-PR
0.263 → 0.337, precision held.

## M. Sub-unit (block) extraction — default ON

Flipped `--blocks` from opt-in (the §B "FP-prone" verdict predated the validated target) to
**default on**: every honest metric improved (pool-precision 0.064 → 0.106, AUC-PR 0.337 →
0.419, recall up, HN-FP flat). Real sub-function clones are small (24–40 tokens), so blocks
share the function size gate rather than a stricter one.

## N. IDF re-ranking rejected (threshold conclusion superseded by §O)

IDF-weighted multiset Jaccard was rejected (AUC-PR flat; the apparent HN-FP drop was just a
stricter operating point). This section also concluded "threshold is a weak lever, precision
tops ~0.16" — **that conclusion is a pool-precision artifact, overturned by §O.** The
IDF rejection stands.

## O. Unbiased precision benchmark — overturns §N

Replaced the biased overlap-weighted pool-precision with a **stratified-random sample by
score band, judge-labeled, population-reweighted** (`precision_sample.v1.json`). Score is in
fact strongly discriminative — §N was an artifact. **Unbiased overall precision = 17.9%**
(pop-reweighted, vs the pool's misleading 10.6%), and the precision-vs-threshold curve is the
load-bearing result:

| operating point | precision | predictions |
|---|---|---|
| ≥ 0.70 | 17.9% | 10,373 |
| ≥ 0.86 | 33% | 5,618 |
| ≥ 0.94 | 40% | 4,549 |

The bottom two bands (0.70–0.86, ~4,755 preds) are ~0% precision — pure noise the 0.70
default admits. **Do not fold the stratified labels back into the pool** (tested: it corrupts
pool-precision 0.106 → 0.060). Lessons: pool-precision is a flawed estimator; the threshold
*is* a strong precision lever (a product decision), not the weak one §N reported.

## P. Iteration loop toward world-class

A goal-driven loop (objective: recall@0.86 up, HN-FP=0 held, no prediction explosion). Net
result: **unbiased precision ~6% → 78% at recall 0.53, HN-FP 0, AUC 0.95.** The wins were
value-content gates, not threshold tuning. Confirmed dead-ends (cut here, recorded once): LSH
param sweeps (P1), callback-arrow extraction (P2), literal-weighted Jaccard (P6), a dual
candidate channel (P9) — all left recall flat because the bottleneck is *matching hard
cross-structure pairs*, not candidate generation. The operating point ≥0.86 was re-confirmed
as the balanced optimum (P10). The shipped sub-points:

- **P3 — string-literal value retention.** The dominant high-score FP was "same structure,
  different string constant" (locale tables, HTTP methods). Retain the string-content hash
  (`Payload::LitStr`) in value-graph keys while the structural tag stays abstract `Str`.
  pool-precision 0.154 → 0.316, AUC-PR 0.328 → 0.759.
- **P4 — literal values in the structural tag (rejected, durable lesson).** Folding values
  into the *shape* tag raised precision but broke known-equivalence fixtures and cost true
  clones. **Literal values belong only in the value graph (soft), never the structural IL —
  the IL's job is to converge equivalent forms.**
- **P5 — score-weight search.** Swept the `(vj, sj, ransac)` simplex at threshold 0.86.
  **Best weights = (0.5, 0.3, 0.2)** — RANSAC down-weighted from 0.5 to 0.2, because it
  rewards token-order agreement but is blind to literal values (locale tables share token
  sequences). Unbiased precision 38.1% → 57.0%.
- **P7 — data-table literal gate.** **A unit whose value-graph is ≥20% literal `Const` nodes
  is a "data table"; such a pair is capped by its literal Jaccard.** Plumbing:
  `value_fingerprint_lits` exposes the literal multiset, `UnitFeat.lits`, threshold env
  `NOSE_DH` (swept: **0.20 is the knee** — 0.15 starts costing recall). Removes 218 verified
  locale-table FPs at zero recall cost.
- **P8 — class-level attribute values in the value graph.** Class units stored data as
  class-level attributes that `process_stmt` put in `env` but never pushed to a sink, so the
  value graph saw class data as empty. Fix: for non-`Func` (class) units, expose final `env`
  values as effect sinks. Unbiased precision 57% → 75.3% (the biggest single gain).
- **P11 — return-signature gate.** The ≥0.94 residual FPs were one-element diffs (`__lt__` vs
  `__gt__` — identical body, different operator) diluted in the multiset. **Cap a pair's score
  by `ret_base + (1 - ret_base)·return_jaccard` when both units return values.** Plumbing:
  `value_fingerprint_lits` (3rd return), `UnitFeat.returns`, env `NOSE_RET` (**0.80 is the
  knee**). Removes 32 verified FPs, precision 75.3% → 78.1%.

## Q. Goal reframe — refactoring-candidate discovery

The strict behavioral judge (§H–P) was the wrong oracle for the *actual* goal: surfacing code
worth a human's refactoring review, where a small FP rate is fine. Under a
refactoring-worthiness rubric, the §P precision gates were *deleting good candidates*. This
split the tool into two operating points — a strict behavioral path (gates on, 0.86) and a
candidate/refactoring path (gates off, **0.70 operating point**) — the seed of today's
`semantic` vs `near` channels. A dual candidate channel was re-tested here and rejected again
(pairs explode 4×, recall flat): candidate generation is architecturally dead for recall.

## R. Performance — frontend parser pool

The frontend (discover + parse + lower) dominates a scan (~88ms warm vs ~13ms pipeline).
**Adopted: a thread-local parser pool** — cache one `tree_sitter::Parser` per grammar per
rayon worker (`lower::parse`); ~1.8× (date-fns 88 → 48ms), byte-identical. (A `SmallVec`
child-list was a noise-level null result — parsing dominates, not allocation.)

## S. Cross-language convergence audit (bug hunt via equivalence testing)

Writing the same algorithm in each language and asserting the units converge to one IL hash
surfaced lowering bugs no single-language test catches. **The durable principle: per-language
coverage (Raw% ≈ 0) does not imply correct convergence — a construct can lower cleanly yet to
the *wrong shape*; one-algorithm-×-N-languages → one-hash convergence tests are the
discriminating check.** Bugs fixed: Rust `*x` deref wrongly became `UnOp(Neg)` (any non-`!`
unary treated as negation); Python f-strings / Ruby interpolation dropped the interpolated
expr (now folded into a `Str`+`Add` chain like `lower_template`); and branch-orientation
produced non-canonical comparisons — `invert_comparison` now returns the canonical operator
plus an operand-swap flag (`Lt`→`Le`+swap). Corpus coverage after fixes: 99.99%.

## T. Performance — parallelize every stage (~14k → ~19.5k files/sec)

parse+lower already scaled 11.6× across cores (CPU-bound on tree-sitter); the wins were in the
remaining stages. **T1 — parallel file discovery** via `ignore`'s parallel walker (33 → 20ms);
crucially, **paths are sorted by name, so a file's `FileId` is deterministic across machines**.
**T2 — sort-based parallel LSH** (3.6×): emit `(band-hash, unit)` entries → `par_sort_unstable`
→ pairs per equal-hash run; byte-identical. **T3 — fuse normalize+extract** into one
`flat_map_iter`, halving peak IL working set. (Pre-sizing the IL arena was slightly slower;
reverted.)

## U. Refactor-worthiness ranking — test-awareness + type-def discount

For the refactoring goal the metric is top-family precision, not Type-4 recall. The dominant
real noise is test duplication and value-poor type definitions. A ranking-time discount (scan
path only; `rank_families`, gold path untouched): each family is tagged `scope = prod | test |
mixed`, and **all-`Class` families with mean `sem < 12` are ×0.25**. Disable with
`NOSE_NO_REFACTOR_DISCOUNT=1`. **Mixed test↔prod is *not* discounted** — logic that lives in
both a test and production is a real smell.

The all-`test` ×0.2 discount this section originally added was **reverted in §U.1**:
duplication in tests is a genuine smell, and suppressing it works against being a copy-paste
recall superset (79% of jscpd-weak findings are in test code). The `scope` tag survives as
reported *context* with no ranking effect; the value-poor type-def discount stays.

## V. jscpd-weak superset — the contiguous channel

Expanding the corpus to 31 repos across all 8 languages exposed that nose was far from a
jscpd-weak superset (all-pairs coverage 18.2%): **jscpd matches arbitrary contiguous token
runs, nose matched unit-bounded families.** Closing the gap needed a second channel.
**V.2 — the contiguous copy-paste channel** (`contiguous.rs`): a Rabin-Karp scan over each
file's **raw-IL** token stream finding maximal duplicated runs regardless of unit boundaries —
the Type-1/2 floor. Built from raw IL because alpha-renaming is function-scoped; honours
`// nose-ignore`. Coverage 18.2% → 78.1%. This is today's `syntax` channel.

## W. Refactoring-family labelset + the product metric

Built the ground-truth eval the goal needs (`bench/labels/`): an unbiased candidate pool
(nose-structural ∪ jscpd-weak) labeled `worthy`/not by a 3-persona LLM panel, dev/held-out
split. Result: worthy-**recall 97%**, **precision@10 57%** — recall is excellent, **ranking
precision is the lever**. ~43% of the top-10 are not-worthy (parallel-by-design, locale/i18n
maps, generated/vendored). This is the measurement foundation the §U/§V false starts lacked.

## X. Ranking precision — labelset-driven

Using the §W labelset as ground truth, **every candidate ranking signal was validated before
shipping — and the labelset rejected most of them, exactly as intended.** Only the
generated/vendored-path discount (×0.1, scan-only) shipped: precision@10 61% → 63%, recall
held at 97%. Rejected: a literal-dominance (`data_ratio`) down-weight (the opposite of the
hypothesis — high `data_ratio` is *more* worthy) and a candidate-mode data-table gate. The
dominant remaining polluters are zod-style locale/version parallel-data variants, structurally
identical to worthy duplication under every cheap signal.

## Y. Anti-unification re-rank — the reframe (metric gain didn't replicate)

The durable reframe: rank by how clean the shared *abstraction* is, not raw duplication
volume — anti-unify two members into a template with `struct_holes`/`value_holes`, where
`value_holes` catch the zod-locale polluter (the holes *are* the content, not a parameter).
The reframe ships later as `--show proposal` (§AF) and informs `extractability` (§AZ). The
simulated **+8pp** precision gain, however, was validated only on the small v1 set and **did
not replicate** on larger labelsets (next sections).

## Z–AD. The re-rank metric was noise; precision power is repo-bound

A multi-section arc (per-language eval, bootstrap CIs, labelsets v2–v4 up to 4,615 families)
that **dissolved its own narrative before anything shipped**. A per-language A/B first showed
the §Y gain was +22pp on TypeScript and −5pp on Rust; bootstrap CIs (§Z–AD) then showed *both*
were within noise and the re-rank gain never replicated heldout (62% → 62%). Two durable
results: **do not ship the uniform re-rank** (recall-side levers are the real ones), and
**per-language precision power is bounded by #repos × 10, not #labels** (P@10 samples only the
top-10/repo), so adding labels per repo doesn't tighten per-language CIs — adding repos does.
"The eval infra paid for itself by dissolving a multi-section false narrative."

## AE. Robustness — never crash on real input

The 62-repo corpus surfaced a stack overflow (deeply-nested minified bundles) in the recursive
lowering walk on rayon's ~2MB worker stacks. Fix: 1 GiB stacks for the workers and the
command thread; regression test `deeply_nested_file_does_not_overflow` (depth 40,000). A clone
detector must never crash on real input.

## AF. Extraction-proposal output (`--show proposal`)

Shipped the §Y reframe as the user-facing proposal view: line-granularity anti-unification
of two representatives (reusing the diff-view LCS) — shared lines become the helper body,
differing runs become `⟨param N⟩`. The current CLI exposes it as `--show proposal`.
Line-level is the pragmatic granularity (sharp on function-level near-dups, coarse on
whole-file clones).

## AG. Lowering closure — every language to non-ERROR Raw ≤ 0.5%

Closed the lowering campaign (begun in §Z–AD, the per-language Raw-gap work) to target: all 9
languages at 0.01–0.25% non-ERROR Raw, no construct > 0.3%. Two disciplines: route stray
statement kinds back through the statement path, and erase type-level nodes to `empty_block`,
not `Raw`. The remaining Raw is essentially all ERROR (tree-sitter parse failures — the
irreducible floor); further Raw fixes would be metric-gaming. `bench/lowering_gaps.py` is the
work-queue dashboard.

---

## AH. The two-axis principle — why "find similar" and "be rigorous" don't conflict

The apparent conflict between finding behaviorally-same code that *looks* different (Type-4
recall) and rejecting off-by-one / wrong-operator near-misses (rigor) is an **architecture
smell, not a goal clash.** Two conflations cause it:

1. **Two purposes under one threshold.** Refactoring/DRY wants recall and tolerates
   near-misses; behavioral-equivalence assertion wants precision and must reject an off-by-one.
   One global threshold cannot serve both.
2. **Two kinds of difference under one scalar.** A single similarity score blurs
   *representation* differences (names, order, sugar, loop form, commutative reorder — which
   Type-4 should ignore) with *behavioral* differences (`+` vs `*`, `>=` vs `>`, constants,
   control flow — which Type-4 must never ignore).

**The resolution — and it is what nose exists to do — is to separate the axes:**
representation differences are absorbed by *exact* canonicalization (alpha-rename, GVN,
commutative sort — push more variation into byte-identical post-normalization); behavioral
differences are measured *strictly* on the residual (an operator swap is a different program,
not a near-miss); and output is graded, not binary, so the consumer picks the cut. The deeper
thesis: token-set similarity was exhausted after 160 experiments, and **rigor is not in tension
with the thesis — rigor *is* the thesis. Hardening the substrate is what enables tolerance: the
more exactly representation variants collapse to identical, the farther-apart forms can safely
be called the same.** This drives work items #1 (the two-axis evaluator) and #3 (the
value-graph loop-recurrence normal form).

## AI. The two-axis evaluator + value-graph reduction normal form

Operationalizes §AH. **#1 — the instrument** (`nose features` + a convergence probe): read
fingerprints *directly*, bypassing the LSH → threshold → union-find pipeline (which confounds
"did the signal converge?" with "did the pipeline surface it?"). It measures value-Jaccard for
*equivalent* pairs (representation axis, want → 1.0) vs *near-miss negatives* (behavior axis,
want → 0.0), the margin between the two clouds, and a threshold-free **rank-separation** =
P(an equivalent pair outscores its family's negatives). The baseline was damning and
clarifying: **representation 0.25, behavior 0.57, margin −0.32, rank-sep 18% — the signal was
inverted** (near-miss bugs looked *more* similar than true Type-4 equivalents).

**#3 — the loop-recurrence normal form** fixed it: thread the recurrence (carry symbolic
prev-iteration values so reductions reach the fingerprint), canonical reductions
`Reduce(⊕, init, contrib)` whose per-element `contrib` keys the value (so sum vs product stay
distinct — behavior preserved), and indexed-`while` induction-variable detection
(`xs[i]` → `Elem(xs)`). Nine increments closed the long tail (HoF → Reduce, guarded/filtered
reductions, min/max selection, zip/`enumerate`), flipping the margin positive. Final:
**representation 0.25 → 0.73, behavior 0.57 → 0.39, margin −0.32 → +0.34, rank-sep 18% → 76%** —
inverted to strongly correct, each transformation family locked by an equivalence test.

Crucially, **§AH is now in the code, forced by a test**: sharpening behavioral precision broke a
candidate-mode test that merged a sum-loop with a product-loop, so **strict mode trusts the
value graph (behavioral); candidate/refactoring mode is structure-dominant (shape-weighted)**,
and two units sharing a skeleton but differing in a behavior-defining operator still surface for
human review. `recursion_iteration` (loop ↔ recursion) is left **explicitly out of v1 scope** as
a meaning-risking rewrite.

## AJ. Behavioral oracle — verifying the value graph is *sound*

A deterministic partial interpreter over the normalized IL (`crates/nose-normalize/src/interp.rs`)
plus a checker (`nose verify`) that groups units by value fingerprint and asserts
**fingerprint-equal ⟹ behavior-equal on every input** (a battery of input vectors per
interpretable function). It is intentionally *partial*: any unmodeled construct (opaque call,
field access, exception) makes the whole unit uninterpretable and it is excluded — never
guessed. (A genuine runtime *type error*, though, is behavior, not an unmodeled construct: e.g.
iterating a non-iterable — a scalar where the battery feeds one to a `for`-each — yields `Err`,
so a foreach-accumulator stays interpretable across the battery instead of being dropped.) It **need not match any language exactly, only be self-consistent**: a genuinely
equivalent pair agrees under any consistent semantics, so a merge the interpreter contradicts is
a real bug. This sets the asymmetry that defines the instrument: **soundness violations are
proofs (every one a real bug); completeness misses are leads (some real, some battery
artifacts).** Run on the 62-repo corpus it caught two violations a synthetic dashboard could not,
then reached SOUND (0 violations) after fixing them: **(1) path-insensitive returns** —
branch-swapped `if c {return A} else {return B}` fingerprinted identically; fix tags each
return/throw with its **path condition**. **(2) duplicate-parameter collapse** — `f(a,a)`
matched `f(data)`; fix seeds parameters by **position**, not cid.

## AK. Wiring the verified value graph into detection (the soundness payoff)

The value-graph work was *stranded*: the detector blended syntactic terms (shape + RANSAC) that
drag a true Type-4 clone below threshold no matter how well `vj` converges. **Because `nose
verify` proved identical value fingerprints ⟹ behaviorally equal (0 false merges across 15k
units), the detector trusts an exact value-fingerprint match outright and accepts it regardless
of syntax** — a one-line fast path, guarded by a minimum fingerprint size. Calibration
(`P(behavior-equal | vj)`) shows a sharp cliff that justifies exact-only:

| value-Jaccard | P(behavior-equal) |
|---|---|
| 1.0 (exact) | **100%** (347,513 pairs) |
| [0.8, 0.9) | ~75% |
| [0.5, 0.8) | ~82% |

**A verified-sound semantic signal can be trusted aggressively, and that trust is what converts
representation convergence into real detection.** The rule that follows: **the remaining
partial-`vj` Type-4 clones must be caught by *raising* their `vj` to exact (more
canonicalization), not by *lowering* the threshold to admit them.** (Synth T4 recall 0/17 →
3/17, 0 FPs; labelset P@10 59% → 62%.)

## AL. Closing the jscpd-superset recall gap (72% → 92%)

Four frontend fixes, no gaming (labelset P@10 59% → 69%, worthy-recall 97% → 99%): recurse into
C `preproc_if`; lower TS type/interface/enum decls to a structural skeleton; emit
import/`#include`/`use` block tokens (54% of misses); and lower the contiguous floor from 20/4
to 10/3 tokens/lines.

## AM. Quantifying value-add over jscpd — the oracle as judge

`bench/value_add.py` uses the §AJ oracle as an independent judge (GOLD = interpretable pairs with
identical non-trivial behavior). Baseline: jscpd recall 90.0%, nose 95.7%, **value-add 57.1%**
(12 of 21 jscpd-missed pairs recovered) at **100% behavioral precision**. The size gate is
critical — 7,391 raw pairs reduce to 211 meaningful ones (97% were trivial fixtures) at
≥5 lines / ≥24 IL tokens.

## AN. Scaling the controlled benchmark — 8 languages, the two-axis guard

Rebuilt the controlled set (742 fixtures / 671 clone pairs, 8 languages × 10 algorithms ×
base/t2/t3/t4/neg + cross-language). Negatives are single-operator behavioral near-misses
(`>` → `!=`) — the no-gaming spine. The benchmark **must report both §AH axes** (candidate vs
behavioral) and read precision off the behavioral axis. (A two-axis precision leak measured here
at 61% was a threshold-measurement bug, corrected to 25% in §AP.)

## AO. Behavioral-axis fix — the counting-loop induction misclassification

A counting accumulator `count += 1` matched the induction-variable shape, was bound to
`idx(xs)`, and never reached a `Reduce` — the whole accumulation evaporated (identical
fingerprints across `>`/`>=`). Fix: a genuine loop counter both steps by a constant **and**
governs the loop condition (intersect `induction_vars` with the condition variables). A textbook
Pareto move — lifts both precision and recall.

## AP. The threshold measurement bug — the real baseline is 25%, not 61%

The benchmark read the behavioral axis through the refactor path's `0.70` candidate default
instead of the detector's calibrated `0.86`, inflating the whole baseline. Corrected: behavioral
neg-FP 61% → 25%, T4-strict 25% → 18%. Separately, a Java `class { method }` wrapper collapsed to
a 2-atom shell (`process_stmt` had no `Func` case); fix: **a container's behavior is the
aggregate of its methods** (`build_unit` descends into each `Func`). Java FPs 20 → 7. This is the
canonical correction later sections defer to.

## AQ. The size gate was the T4 recall blocker, not the value graph

The missed T4 forms were dense one-liners (`sum(v for v in xs if v>0)`, `max(xs)`); the value
graph *does* converge them (jaccard 1.00), but they fell below the unit size gate and were never
extracted. Fix, in the spirit of §AH (**gate on *semantic* content, not surface size**): admit a
frontend-tagged function below the line/token gate when its value fingerprint is rich enough
(`value.len() >= 6`, the floor the exact-match path already requires). The largest single
increment, clean Pareto: value-add 57% → 66%, precision held.

## AR. Two idiom fixes (partial)

`functools.reduce(f, xs, init)` was misrouted through the method-HoF arm (treating the
`functools` module as the collection); special-cased to `Builtin::Reduce`. And swapped-polarity
guarded folds (`acc + v if v > 0 else acc`) gained the swapped `Phi` case. Both sound but
partial — the Python idiom long tail has diminishing returns.

## AS. Soundness bug hunt — seven false merges, each with a reproducer

An adversarial hunt for false merges (the corpus oracle reported 0, so bugs were crafted as
one-dimension near-miss pairs). **fingerprint-equal must imply behavior-equal.** Seven bugs, each
locked by a `tests/equivalence.rs` reproducer (fails before, passes after), in two families:

**Family A — loop iteration-extent dropped** (the value graph abstracted `C[i]` → `Elem(C)` as
if every loop visited all of `C`): **(1) range-start** — `range(len(a))` ≡ `range(1, len(a))`,
now only a provably-full range licenses the `Elem` rewrite; **(2) while-stride** — `i += 1` ≡
`i += 2`, only unit-stride zero-start counters are full indices; **(3) early-break** —
prefix-sum-with-`break` ≡ full sum, `break` now records its path condition as a distinct sink.

**Family B — identity/value dropped in lowering or alpha-renaming:** **(4) slice bounds
(Python)** — `a[1:]` ≡ `a[:1]`, collecting only *named* slice children dropped which slot the
bound occupied; **(5) slice/range bounds (Go, Rust)** — same collapse, plus Rust merged `1..2`
with `1..=2`; **(6) free-variable collapse** — alpha-rename gave *every* name a positional cid so
`foo(x)` ≡ `bar(x)` and `max(a,b)` ≡ `min(a,b)`; now only *bound* names are renamed, free names
keep identity (zero recall cost); **(7) boolean literal values** — `True` ≡ `False` (abstracted to
a valueless `Lit(Bool)`); added `Payload::LitBool(bool)` end-to-end.

## AT. Reconsidering the "lossy approximations" — `in` was a bug too

Auditing the §AS "deliberate lossy approximations" found an eighth rationalized bug: `in`/`is` →
`Op::Eq` was unsound — membership is non-commutative (`a in b` ≢ `b in a`) and lowering dropped
negation. Fix: a non-commutative `Op::In` (interp gained a membership arm); `not in`/`is not` keep
negation. This established the **standing three-way classification** that
[normalization](normalization.md)'s soundness constraint now states:

- **Rationalized bugs** — none known; the §AS seven and `in` are fixed.
- **Genuine limitation, not "acceptable"** — string/list concatenation via a commutative `+`
  (`s + x` ≡ `x + s`) is unsound, but a sound fix needs type/sequence inference a type-free
  cross-language tool lacks (first supplied as `types.rs`, later moved to `ValueDomain` /
  `ValueLaw` contracts in `nose-semantics`; §AW/§BA).
- **Legitimate fuzzy tradeoff, but mis-placed** — large-constant / float abstraction
  (`x % 7` ≡ `x % 11`) belongs on the candidate axis, not the shared value graph (it violates the
  behavioral axis's "constants must be distinct" rule). The principled fix is an axis split.

## AU. Cross-field divergence → the precision frontier → v5 settles the re-rank

Six subagents brainstorming from different fields **all converged on the same architecture —
structure-invariant *candidate generation* → behavioral *confirmation* (the oracle as generator,
not just checker).** Two concrete bets were refuted by measurement (behavioral-near-match gating;
symmetry-orbit/naming-parallelism — zero separation). The product reframe: **worthy-recall is
solved (~100%); the headroom is precision, and 62% of the precision loss is one category —
`parallel-by-design`.** Growing the gold set to v5 (105 repos, 9,461 families) settled the §Y
abstractness re-rank: **it does not generalize** (the v4 +5pp dev gain collapses to ~0 heldout, a
Rust-only effect) — **do not ship it.** The precision frontier is real and **judgment-deep**; the
remaining lever is an LLM-judge re-ranker, not another cheap feature.

## AV. The precision loss is judgment-deep all the way down

There is no cheap *sound* structural gate for the "detectable" not-worthy categories — type-def
vs extract-base, trivial vs worthy-parameterize, generated — each is entangled with worthy
lookalikes of *identical shape* (e.g. httpx `get/post/put → request(VERB)` is structurally
identical to a non-worthy thin delegation). The §Y abstractness re-rank nets positive only for
Rust, and only because Rust's *base* value-rank is poor (it buries clean small helpers under
module-level matches); elsewhere it demotes worthy larger families. The genuine,
language-agnostic sub-signal is "base value-rank under-ranks small clean helpers" — which §AZ
exploits.

## AW. Core-hardening — sound foundation + machine-checked canons + type inference

A deliberate pivot from the judgment-deep product metric toward a *sound and capable core*, with
**the verifier as the safety net for bold attempts: an unsound canon shows up instantly as a
false merge and gets rolled back.** **Phase 0** drove false merges 15 → 0 via five
language-general fixes (subtree-hash keying for `Raw` nodes, dead-code-after-unconditional-return
drop, last-write-wins per field, `Err` propagation through conditions, excluding empty
fingerprints from `verify`). **Phase 1** moved the soundness contract from empirical ("0 merges on
N repos") to **proven in Lean 4** (`normalize.value_graph.algebra`,
`normalize.control_flow.guard_returns`, `normalize.value_graph.functor`:
AC-flatten+sort denotation-preserving, `a − b → a + (−b)`, guard-clause ≡ if-else, map-fusion
functor law). Bold canons were verifier-gated: untyped `-(-x) → x` / `x & x → x` were **refuted
(caught 17 false merges** — they drop the operator's type-error behavior), then re-enabled
*soundly* via purpose-fit type inference (`types.rs` at the time, now `ValueDomain` /
`ValueLaw` contracts in `nose-semantics`; coarse Num/Bool/Str/List/Unknown):
**`+` commutes unless an operand is proven string/list; Unknown still commutes, so the common
numeric case is unaffected.** The standing principle: **each canon is justified by correctness +
soundness + a proof, not by moving a noisy completeness number** (which is insensitive to any one
correct canon).

## AX. The independent oracle — unmasking the commutativity-of-non-commutative-ops bug class

§AW's verifier had a hole: it interpreted the *same fully-normalized IL it fingerprinted*, so any
behavior-changing canon **masked itself** (`a or b` and `b or a` both sorted to one IL, looked
identical). **A differential oracle must not share its subject's canonicalization, or it certifies
the very rewrites it should police.** The fix: it now interprets the **pre-canonicalization core
IL (`desugar` + `alpha` only, via `NormalizeOptions.oracle`), matched to each fully-normalized
unit by source span, while still fingerprinting the full normalize.** This exposed a whole bug
class — treating non-commutative operators as commutative — each a real latent false merge fixed at
root: value-`and`/`or` short-circuit (commutativity type-gated on Bool, else a positional `Phi`),
`!!x → x` (`!!5` = true ≠ 5), `not(Err) → Bool(true)` must propagate, `x*1 → x` / `x+0 → x`
unsound for non-numeric, and string/list `+` operand sort (concat is non-commutative). A second,
**pair-free canon-preservation check** (interpret each unit on core IL *and* full IL, require equal
behavior) flagged 20 concat sites with no colliding twin needed. Result: `verify` = 0 false merges
under the independent oracle, canon-preservation = 0 behavior-changing units. (The completeness
ratio dip 62% → ~59% is honest oracle fidelity — the denominator grew — not a regression.)

## AY. Re-sweeping the log with the better system (types + v5 + oracle)

Re-tried old blockers the hardened system might lift. Three IL adoptions: existence/universal loop
forms (`for … return True/False` ≡ `any`/`all`), collection-building loops ≡
comprehensions/`.map`/`.collect` (cross-language, +8 completeness), and float-constant distinction
(retained source-text hash — floats had collapsed to one token, a latent false merge the float-less
oracle couldn't see). One rejection: doubling `x*2 ≡ x+x` (made `verify` ~10× slower for a marginal
idiom). Critically, all three adoptions *strengthened* the behavioral fingerprint yet v5 P@10 did
not move — **empirically confirming the precision ceiling is judgment-deep, not
semantic-signal-limited.**

## AZ. Extractability as the default ranking — the re-rank that *does* generalize

§AU/§AV settled that a uniform abstractness re-rank does not generalize. The **`extractability`
ranking — now the default sort for `nose scan`** — is not that re-rank: instead of a bare
abstractness multiplier it scores *invariant (shared) source lines × copies × spread* with three
correctives the prototype lacked — **tightness** (shared/total, so a 22/384 dispatch skeleton can't
outrank a 15/15 pair), a **parameter penalty** (a 30-hole "helper" is scaffolding), and an **IDF
idiom-gate** (pervasive lines like `if err != nil {` contribute ~0) — plus zero-invariant-line
families score 0 (the structural-only `sim 1.00` pathology) and a type-def/generated discount;
cross-language families fall back to the structural estimate. In the historical §AZ slice it was
the first ranking change to move the held-out number in the right direction (held-out +6pp,
dev flat, no recall cost, reordering only). The durable lesson is that a re-rank built from
what actually extracts (tight, few-param, non-idiom shared lines) generalized where one built
from raw structural abstractness did not. For current reproducible P@10/recall numbers, use
[benchmark](benchmark.md); `--sort value` is retained for raw-volume triage, and detection is
unchanged (same families, only order and the `N/M shared · Pp` cell differ).

## BA. Exact-Type-4 convergence push — stronger types, Lean-backed algebra, filter fusion

A focused pass to raise *exact* Type-4 convergence while holding full-corpus `verify` = 0 and
backing each algebraic law with a Lean proof. **Adopted** (93 equivalence tests green, SOUND):
fixpoint param-type inference over subexpression result types (`types.rs` at the time, now
`ValueDomain` / `ValueLaw` contracts in `nose-semantics`, licensing the gated numeric rewrites);
distribution/factoring `a*c + b*c → (a+b)*c` gated on proven Num
(`NoseAlgebra.distrib_sound`); full **AC canonicalization in the value graph itself** (`mk`
flattens+sorts `+ * & | ^`, so *synthesized* nodes re-canonicalize, not only the IL algebra pass);
**filter fusion** representing `filter(p, c)` as a filtered identity-map `Hof(Map, [Elem c, p])` so
nested filters fuse to `p ∧ q` (`NoseFunctor.filter_fusion` — the deferred "make Filter carry its
element"; an earlier peel-to-bare-`Filter` caused 2 false merges, this does not); reduce-lambda
min/max selection; count-of-filter; method-form iterator reductions
(`xs.iter().filter(p).sum()` ≡ Python `sum(… if p)`); and **dict-builder ≡ dict-comprehension**,
sound by *representation* — `DictEntry` is a distinct node from a tuple `Seq` (guarded by
`assert_ne!`), since dicts are not oracle-modeled. **Rejected as cross-language unsound:** doubling
`x*2 ≡ x+x` (canonical form depends on whether operands prove Num) and negative-index
`s[-1] ≡ s[len(s)-1]` (last-element in Python/Ruby, undefined in JS) — both *genuine
language-semantic divergences, not representation gaps.* Verdict: **full-corpus `verify` stays 0
false merges across 28,113 interpretable units, and the v5 refactoring-precision number is
unchanged — reconfirming §AY that behavioral-convergence gains don't move the judgment-deep
number while costing nothing there. The win is squarely on the exact-Type-4 axis.** The Lean core
gained the `normalize.value_graph.compare` obligation; a `formal` CI job regression-checks all
theorems.

## BB. Confluence audit + lattice comparison canon (rules, not a new engine)

Probed the "replace ordered passes with an e-graph / equality saturation" thesis by first
*measuring* whether the recursive `mk` already behaves as a fixpoint: seven phase-ordering-stressing
equivalences → **6/7 already converge** (including multi-step `a*c + b*c + d*c → (a+b+d)*c`). This
reproduces §C/§AW by construction: **the lever is new sound rules, not a better rule-application
engine** — an e-graph would still need each rule declared, and the fixpoint it buys is largely
already present. The one gap was the lattice identity `(x ≤ y) ∧ (x ≠ y) ≡ x < y`; adding just that
one rule (`value_graph.rs lattice_le_ne_to_lt` + dual) *composes through the `mk` fixpoint* to close
the full cross-language `not(a > b or a == b) ≡ a < b`. Sound on any total order
(`normalize.value_graph.compare`).

## BC–BF. Behavioral-equivalence gate and widening the oracle

A four-part thread (a research subcommand only — not a detection channel) that probed using the
interpreter oracle as an in-loop *acceptance gate*, then chased the lead it surfaced.

- **BC — the gate has no headroom.** On a 10k synthetic corpus, exact fingerprint already merges
  100% of interpretable positives, so behavioral acceptance recovers nothing and only adds false
  merges. A wider input battery cut false merges 7.9% → 5.5% but never to zero — reaffirming the §AK
  cliff that *only exact equality is 100% sound.* The actionable finding inverts the hypothesis:
  **the interpreter oracle, not the fingerprint, is now the weaker model** (behavioral recall 64.9%
  vs the fingerprint's 100%, because map/option/string predicates fall outside the interpreter's
  faithful Int/Bool/Str/List domain).
- **BD — the lead was mis-aimed.** Classifying 1,056 synthetic `verify` "violations": ≈98% are
  numeric reductions in C aligned-array form `f(int *xs, int n)` merged by the "`n` is exact length"
  contract while the oracle feeds a *free* `n` — i.e. **the C pointer-length contract, not maps**
  (maps are <2%). Modeling `GetOrDefault` was inert because `verify` interprets the pre-canon core
  IL (§AX) where a map-default is still raw indexing; reverted.
- **BE — the pointer-length contract, executed.** The oracle now binds `n = len(array)` per battery
  row where `full_pointer_length_contract` fires (the same contract the value graph used to merge).
  Synthetic violations **1,056 → 508 (−52%, strictly monotone)**; real-code `verify` stays SOUND.
- **BF — rebase verdict (what survived a refactored `main`).** A later `main` removed a family of
  interpreter builtins (`IsEmpty`/`Contains`/`GetOrDefault`/…) and changed some lowerings (Java
  `Math.min(a,b)` now an opaque call, not `Builtin::Min`). **Obsoleted and dropped:** map-read and
  nullish/option modeling (depended on the deleted builtins) and two-arg scalar `min`/`max` (now
  inert). **Survived / re-validated:** the §BB lattice canon (`convergence_probe5` 10/10) and the
  §BC–BF pointer-length contract (re-measured 800 → 252). The durable lesson: **a soundness-oracle
  improvement is durable only insofar as the IL shape it keys on is durable** — canons keyed on
  stable value-graph structure survived; builtin-keyed modeling did not.

## BG. Hazard ranking — divergent-edit calibration from mined history

A *severity* ranking ([hazard-ranking](hazard-ranking.md)) distinct from extractability:
rank families by how likely they are to be edited inconsistently and cause a bug. The
literature ([hazard-benchmark](hazard-benchmark.md)) gave the signals and directions but
not the weights, so we mined ground truth before implementing.

- **BG-data.** Used nose as a cross-revision linker (`eval/hazard/`): monthly snapshots
  of **12 repos across 8 languages** (django, pandas, kafka[Java], terraform, hugo, tokio,
  ripgrep, redis, vue-core, express; thrift[X], grpc[X]), labeling each family-interval by
  Kim's Inconsistent-Change from `git diff` over member spans; **G2** = a G1 whose changed
  sibling's *function* was modified by a bug-fix commit that did not propagate (git
  `-L:funcname`). **462,569 events; 4,639 divergent edits (G1), 181 "G2" over 15,199
  families.** Function-level attribution landed the G2 *rate* in the literature's 1–3%
  range — **but an LLM-judge audit of all 181 found the G2 label only ~11% precise**
  (48 message false-matches, 47 intentional divergences, 41 not-clones). So **G2 is
  retracted as a gold label**; validation rests on the clean, directly-observed **G1**.
- **BG-finding — the pre-data formula was mis-specified.** Leave-one-repo-out logistic
  weights (stable): `mean_lines` **+0.43** (top), `modules` **+0.28**, `mean_sem`
  **−0.27 (anti)**, `invisibility` **+0.14**, `members` +0.13, `params` +0.04 (noise — sign
  flipped from −0.06 at 7 repos). The first-draft design led with `mean_sem` as the
  *primary* multiplier — but semantic-fingerprint size is **anti-predictive** for
  divergent-edit ranking (typical divergences are in smaller families; the mean is a
  large-tail artifact). Source-**line** span is the real magnitude signal.
- **BG-formula.** `hazard = mean_lines × spread(files,modules,languages) × invisibility ×
  scope_weight` — leave-one-repo-out AUC **G1 0.644** vs **0.609** size-led draft, 0.611
  value-baseline, ~0.49 random. **Implemented as opt-in `--sort hazard`**;
  `extractability` stays the default fixability axis. The param-dampening term tested
  earlier was dropped (sign-unstable weight).
  `invisibility` (1−tightness) is a modest, stable general signal (+0.14). **Correction:**
  a first draft claimed it was "the top signal in the cross-language stratum (0.67)" —
  but that was a repo-level mislabel (thrift+grpc tagged X). True cross-language families
  are structurally rare (37 of 15,199; arrow 0 of 928), so the cross-language-specific
  claim is retracted; invisibility holds as a general predictor.
- **BG-audit — the gold label was mostly noise.** An LLM judge reviewed all 181 G2 events
  blind (`audit_sample.py` rebuilds the two members' code + the bug-fix commit): **strict
  precision 11% (20/180)**. False sources: 48 message false-matches (the bug-fix keyword
  caught version drops, features, typo/docs/config changes), 47 intentional divergences
  (async/sync, virtual/stored, test variants that legitimately differ), 41 not-clones
  (near@0.70 grouped trivial stubs). The lesson: `rate-match ≠ precision`, and a real gold
  label needs the LLM judge *as the labeler*, not the keyword heuristic. The 20 confirmed
  positives seed a real (small) gold set.
- **BG-gold — the formula predicts propensity, not harm.** Built that real gold: an LLM
  labeled 1,390 G1 candidates blind *with the diff* into harm/should-propagate/benign,
  adversarial pass refuting weak positives (`build_candidates.py` → `gold-label-divergence`
  → `gold_eval.py`). Only 22 (strict) / 53 (lenient) are genuine should-propagate harms
  (~1.6–3.8%, reproducing the literature's 1–3%). On this gold, AUC for harmful-vs-benign
  divergence: `mean_sem` 0.61–0.64 (the *dropped* feature, best), `extractability`
  0.59–0.64, **`hazard` 0.51 (chance)**, value 0.42. **The G1 0.64 does not transfer to
  harm** — propensity ≠ harm, and static features cap ~0.6 (harm depends on whether a
  change *applies to the sibling*, a semantic question). Also: 50% of candidates are not
  real clones (near@0.70 precision). → `hazard` reverted to opt-in (default stays
  `extractability`); subsequent rounds test whether git-history, larger gold, and better
  clone precision can move the ceiling.
- **BG-gold2 — the structural+history ceiling is ~0.60 (definitive).** Did all three:
  a clone-quality gate (`shared_weight≥4`), a larger gold (2,296 labeled, 51 confirmed
  harm positives, usable CIs), and a git-history feature (blame: were the changed vs
  lagging member last touched *together*?). Harm-AUC: `-skew_days` 0.600, `mean_sem` 0.572,
  `same_commit` 0.568, `hazard` 0.531, `extractability` 0.475; a leave-one-repo-out logistic
  **combination 0.524 — no lift.** git-history is real and theory-aligned (harm happens in
  families previously maintained *together*, Barbour/Kim) but weak and only ~52%
  computable; the gate still left 46% non-clones. **Conclusion: clone-structural +
  git-history features cannot rank harm above ~0.60.** Harm is semantic — the LLM judge
  captures it (the gold's basis), metrics do not. The evidence-indicated harm ranker is a
  **bounded LLM pass over top-K structurally-surfaced candidates**, not more features.
- **BG-gold3 — cognitive complexity (#23) moved the ceiling, post-divergence.** Tested
  the parked #23 edit-surface idea on the same gold from captured member code/diff
  (`cogcomplexity.py`, `harm_model.py`). `diff_per_cog` (a small subtle change in a
  *complex* function — Krinke "critical change") harm-AUC **0.65**, the best signal yet —
  but it needs the diff, so it is a **post-divergence** signal. The best **pre-divergence**
  signal is `cog` (member cognitive complexity) at ~0.61 (≈ prior ceiling). The #23
  axis-B "edit-surface symmetry" hypothesis was wrong (asymmetry AUC 0.44); absolute
  complexity × change locality is the signal. Combos still do not lift (logistic 0.595 on
  51 positives). Revised view: harm is best assessed *after* a divergence (it is a
  property of the realized edit), where #23 reaches ~0.65 — a usable **post-divergence**
  ranker. Pre-divergence ranking still caps ~0.61.
- **BG-gold4 — does the IL obscure cognitive complexity? No (tested).** Worry: cog is a
  surface property, the IL normalizes for equivalence. `il_cog.py` computed cog from
  `nose il --normalized` (If/Loop + nesting + And/Or) vs the source-text proxy on the gold
  (95% IL parse rate): **harm-AUC 0.599 (IL) vs 0.597 (source) — identical.** Control
  structure survives `il --normalized`; only the deeper value-fingerprint collapse
  (loop≡comprehension, = `mean_sem`) erases it, and cog is not computed from that. Flip
  side: a fancier IL-cog will NOT beat the proxy — cog is ~0.60 regardless of
  representation. **Firmly established: the pre-divergence structural harm ceiling is
  ~0.60 across every representation and feature; only `diff_per_cog` (post-divergence,
  0.65) is above it. A strong harm ranker needs the semantic (LLM) layer.**
- **BG-durability.** Labels are git-derived (version-independent); features/families are
  nose-derived (stamped `nose_ver`). Only *detection* changes force a re-mine+re-tune;
  ranking changes (this work) do not. Refresh = `run_corpus.sh` + `tune.py` (minutes,
  cached clones); per-release steps in [hazard-release-checklist](hazard-release-checklist.md).

## BH. Scan performance — normalize proof lookup, not path exclusions

Profiling real corpora across Rust (`nose-normalize`, `nose-detect`), TypeScript
(`moonlight-server`, `moonlight-web`, `tex`), Python (`episteme2-app`), and Go
(`sah-cli`) showed that semantic/near scans were bottlenecked in the shared
`normalize+extract` path, not in JS-specific parsing or candidate scoring. Large generated
JS bundles can dominate an unscoped scan, but the product fix is not a built-in generated-path
exclusion; benchmark scoping used only the existing `--exclude`/config mechanism.

The hot path was `desugar` repeatedly re-scanning the whole IL to prove receiver-domain
facts for method/property idiom recognition. Replacing that with a shared
receiver-domain cache kept the exact same proof policy while removing repeated O(nodes)
lookups; the cache now lives behind the semantic-kernel facade rather than a normalize-local
side table. Additional behavior-preserving cleanup reserved rebuild arena capacity, avoided
per-node child `Vec` copies in common rebuild loops, reused file-local scope facts in value
fingerprinting, and skipped no-op recursion/dataflow/algebra/cfg-orientation rebuilds.

Representative output JSON was byte-equivalent to `origin/main` after canonical sorting
(`nose-normalize`, `nose-detect`, `moonlight-server`, `tex`, `sah-cli`, and
`craken-cli`; earlier matrix runs also covered `episteme2-app` and scoped
`moonlight-web`). After rebasing onto `origin/main@42545f2`, representative
`NOSE_TIME` deltas for `normalize+extract` were: `nose-normalize` semantic
1452ms→228ms (6.4x), near 1457ms→236ms (6.2x); `tex` semantic 445ms→64ms
(7.0x); `moonlight-server` semantic 48ms→27ms (1.8x); `sah-cli` semantic
12ms→9ms (1.3x). Whole-pipeline speedups are lower where parse/lower now
dominates; this moves the next performance frontier toward lower/parse and remaining
multi-pass normalization overhead rather than file selection policy.

Follow-up profiling split frontend timing into `parse+lower` and `import-resolve`
inside `NOSE_TIME`. The import pass is corpus-level, not JS-specific: sibling literal
exports are modeled through language semantics for Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java,
and Rust, while unsupported languages such as Go/C/Ruby do not build the added indexes.
Caching file top-level statements, path-derived module hashes, and binding-use facts
reduced representative `import-resolve` costs without changing output JSON: `tex`
~31–34ms→~4ms, `moonlight-server` ~21–25ms→~6ms, `nose-normalize` ~7–8ms→<1ms,
and `episteme2` ~6–7ms→~2ms; Go corpora stayed at 0ms. Two tempting follow-ups were
rejected after output checks: skipping import resolution for `syntax`-only scans changed
`moonlight-server` syntax families, and caching pure-inline registries changed one
Python near-family. Both are behavior changes, not safe speedups.

## BI. Language profile pass — file roots, not language-specific exclusions

A follow-up language-by-language semantic scan profiled Python, JavaScript, TypeScript,
Go, Rust, Java, C, Ruby, and embedded-script containers on local corpus repos. The goal
was to avoid repeating the earlier JS-specific trap: large bundles can be expensive, but
the product should not learn new built-in file/path exclusions. The safe optimization was
in discovery mechanics instead:

- direct file roots now bypass `ignore`'s directory walker when no `--exclude`/config
  excludes are active;
- directory discovery now checks `Path::extension()` before allocating a path string, so
  unsupported files do not pay string allocation just to be rejected;
- embedded `<script>` tag TypeScript detection uses case-insensitive byte search instead
  of allocating a lowercase copy of the tag;
- semantic extraction skips normalization only for a raw IL that is exactly an empty
  module, preserving top-level block extraction for files that have executable statements.

The representative before/after medians below used `NOSE_TIME=1 nose scan --mode semantic
--top 0 --format json`, five repetitions after the change, and the same corpus inputs as
the baseline run:

| language | files | baseline wall | after wall | result |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| python | 128 | 79.7ms | 79.1ms | stable |
| javascript | 5 | 110.7ms | 114.3ms | stable/noisy; generated-bundle cost remains a scoping issue |
| typescript | 263 | 133.0ms | 126.6ms | small common-path win |
| go | 54 | 53.3ms | 52.4ms | stable |
| rust | 37 | 500.7ms | 464.9ms | small common-path win; output diff was only shifted line numbers in edited Rust files |
| java | 13 | 89.0ms | 4.5ms | file-root discovery fixed the benchmark-shape overhead |
| c | 1241 | 546.7ms | 532.9ms | small common-path win |
| ruby | 1722 | 249.3ms | 220.6ms | small common-path win |
| embedded | 61 | 381.2ms | 26.8ms | file-root discovery fixed the benchmark-shape overhead |

Canonical JSON output was unchanged for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Java, C, Ruby,
and embedded. Rust matched after removing line-number fields; the only diff came from this
branch adding lines to a Rust source file included in the profiling input.

## BJ. The design.md §5 recall-ceiling probe — sub-DAG / inlining headroom, measured

[design](design.md) §5 named one decisive measurement that had never been run: *on the
gold set, how many missed worthy pairs would largest-common-pure-sub-DAG matching (and
helper inlining) recover?* §3 gates any further recall-mechanism bet on it. Context that
makes the question sharper: PR #82 already shipped a bounded v1 of **both** mechanisms
(shared heavy anchors at weight ≥ 20 / df ≤ 6 in `near` candidate mode; single-`return`
file-local pure inlining in the value graph), so the probe measures the **residual**
beyond everything reachable today.

**Method** (`bench/labels/recall_ceiling_probe.py`, artifact
`bench/labels/recall_ceiling_probe_2026_06_10.json`): for every worthy v5 label, two
scans — arm0 = the default surface (`syntax,semantic`), arm1 = the maximal current
surface (`syntax,semantic,near --min-value 0`). Labels arm1 misses are classified from
`nose features` dumps of the member files: **subdag-ceiling** if the two members'
tightest covering units share value-fingerprint multiset-intersection mass ≥ 8
(reported also at 12/20; 20 = the shipped `ANCHOR_MIN_WEIGHT`), **inline-ceiling** if
one same-file sibling unit's multiset added to either side lifts the mass over 20,
**same-unit-window** if both members map into one enclosing unit (the statement-window
shape), **no-overlapping-unit** if a member has no unit at all, else **unrecovered**.
Multiset intersection ignores connectivity and single-file `features` lacks whole-repo
import resolution, so the sub-DAG/inline classes **over-approximate** — a ceiling, not a
forecast. Caveats: the original run excluded `rxjs` for a scanner stack overflow later
fixed by #198; corpus was dir-pruned but not file-pruned because `prune_corpus.py` was
missing at the time. Follow-up #200 restored the script and checked-in prune manifest.

**Result** (4,921 worthy labels; dev / heldout):

| | dev | heldout |
|---|---:|---:|
| worthy-recall, arm0 (default) | 86.2% | 88.5% |
| worthy-recall, arm1 (maximal current) | 94.3% | 96.4% |
| arm1-missed | 161 | 74 |
| — subdag-ceiling (mass ≥ 8) | 64 | 35 |
| — inline-ceiling | 11 | 4 |
| — same-unit-window | 19 | 9 |
| — no-overlapping-unit | 29* | 13* |
| — unrecovered (shared mass ≈ 0) | 38 | 13 |

*combined with the residual `other` classes in the per-language table the script prints.

Of the 99 subdag-ceiling labels, only **31** reach the shipped anchor weight (mass ≥ 20;
median mass 14) — i.e. at the weight the product already considers extractable, the
unit-pair sub-DAG residual is **0.6%** absolute worthy-recall; even the optimistic
mass ≥ 8 ceiling is **2.0%**, and the one-step inlining ceiling is **0.3%**.

**Verdict — the §3 gate answers "no-go" for a headline mechanism bet.** The shipped #82
mechanisms plus the `near` channel already recover the bulk (630 default-surface misses
→ 235 maximal-surface misses); what remains is not a unit-pair matching gap:

- the **no-overlapping-unit** cluster is a *unit-extraction* gap with two concrete,
  nameable shapes — Ruby test-DSL blocks (`asciidoctor`, 21 labels) and Rust
  `macro_rules!` bodies (`clap` `macros.rs`, 14 labels) — frontier-evidence material
  (#36 discipline), not matcher work;
- **same-unit-window** (28) is the statement-window fragment axis the coverage taxonomy
  already tracks;
- **unrecovered** (51) shares ~zero value mass — parameterize/extract-helper judgments
  whose similarity is not in the computation at all (the §AV judgment-deep shape).

The one cheap knob left on the table: the 8–20 mass band (68 labels) would respond to a
lower anchor weight floor, but those small shared chunks are weak refactor targets and
the band is an over-approximation — worth at most a knob experiment
(`NOSE_ANCHOR_*`), not a mechanism. The honest headline for further worthy-recall is
**unit extraction coverage and the fragment axis, not more matching**.

## BK. The independent miss-mining arm — measuring in-the-wild misses (modality B)

The §BJ probe answered the *mechanism* question; this answers the *measurement* one
(#194): the v5 pool is nose ∪ jscpd, so semantic clones missed by **both** can't appear
in any recall denominator. `bench/type4/miss_mining.py` is the independent arm: per
pinned repo, LSH-band the detection minhash over all ≥ 5-line/≥ 40-token units, confirm
candidate pairs by exact value-multiset Jaccard (≥ 0.80), and keep pairs **no family on
the maximal current surface co-reports**. Output is a queue signal only (#36 two-layer
discipline): every record carries `evidence_tier: detector-suggested`, annotated with
`fp_equal`, `exact_safe`, and a source `text_similarity` ratio so the
textually-dissimilar tail (the jscpd-shaped blind spot) is sliceable. The complementary
modality A — behavior-equal fingerprint-split pairs — is the existing
`nose verify --leads`. Artifact: `bench/type4/miss_mining_2026_06_10.json`
(104 repos; original run excluded `rxjs` for the stack overflow later fixed by #198).

**Result: 593 candidates corpus-wide, and the audit says the residual is structured,
small, and mostly *not* detector-recall.**

| class | n | read |
|---|---:|---|
| fp-equal, same-file, not exact-safe | 375 | parameterized-test / scaffolding bodies, annotation-varying twins |
| fp-equal, cross-file | 78 | dominated by generated code (`etcd` protobuf `*.pb.go`) — correctly excluded from ranking by the generated-file policy |
| fp-equal, same-file, exact-safe | 44 | small proven twins, mostly test scaffolds |
| vj ∈ [0.8, 1.0), mixed | 96 | the only class with worthy-shaped finds |

Spot-audit of the non-fp-equal cross-file slice found one clearly worthy-shaped miss —
`libgdx` `Widget.pack()` ≡ `WidgetGroup.pack()` (identical method duplicated across
sibling classes; impure, vj 0.80 < the 0.90 value-accept, shapes split, so no channel
fires) — among stub/parallel-by-design neighbours (curl no-op callbacks, sympy protocol
type-defs). The deeper catch was mechanical: chasing *why* fp-equal `exact_safe` pairs
(`junit5` annotation-varying `fail(...)` methods) never surface exposed that **adding
the syntax channel can drop an exact semantic family the semantic channel reports
alone** — a channel-merge reporting bug, closed by #202. The fix drops
single-site windows after same-file coalescing before they can subsume reportable
multi-site semantic families.
That is the arm working as designed: candidates are cheap, and each audited one either
dies as scaffolding/generated (raising confidence in the policy layers) or names a
precise defect.

Honest bottom line for the in-the-wild recall question: at vj ≥ 0.8 the unreported mass
is ~600 pairs across 59k files, overwhelmingly generated/scaffolding; the worthy-shaped
tail is a handful per corpus — consistent with §BJ's "no headline recall mechanism
left" verdict. Below vj 0.8 (true different-algorithm Type-4) this arm is blind by
construction; that frontier remains unmeasured and would need a behavior- or
embedding-based candidate source — recorded as the arm's known limit, not claimed
covered.

## BL. Oracle exclusion census — the real-corpus completeness baseline, by construct

§BC measured the oracle's *behavioral recall* on a synthetic corpus (64.9%); what the
soundness campaign actually needed was the **real-corpus inventory**: how much of the
fingerprint-merge surface carries no behavioral verification at all, and *which IL
constructs* keep units out of the interpreter. `nose verify --exclusion-census`
(`crates/nose-cli/src/verify_census.rs`) records every counted function unit's oracle
outcome, fingerprint, and raw construct tags — for excluded AND interpretable
populations, deriving the discriminating constructs at analysis time instead of
hard-coding an "unsupported" list that would rot when lowerings change (the §BC–BF
durability lesson). Run per repo (merge pairs counted within a repo, matching how scans
run) and merged by `bench/labels/merge_exclusion_census.py`; artifact
`bench/labels/oracle_exclusion_census_2026_06_10.json` (104 repos; `raylib` excluded —
verify does not finish on it in useful time, #208).

**Baseline.** 591,469 function units; **26,382 interpretable (4.5%)** — 526,660
battery-bail, 38,427 empty-fingerprint. Of 3,444,062 within-repo fingerprint-equal
pairs, **316,677 (9.2%) are oracle-verified; 3,127,385 (90.8%) carry no behavioral
check**. (Upper bound on the product surface: the census sees verify-side units, not
the detector's `exact_safe` gate, so some unverified mass can never reach the exact
channel anyway — stated limitation, not a correction we can compute here.)

**Discriminating constructs** (excl-share ≥ 98%, ≥ 1k excluded units, by unverified
mass): `call:other` — calls that are neither admitted builtins nor named/cid calls —
dominates at **481k excluded units / 1.71M unverified pairs**, followed by
`kind:Field` reads (420k / 1.30M), statement shapes riding on them (`ExprStmt`, `If`,
`UnOp`, `Throw`, `Lambda`, `Try`), and `lit:unretained:Other` — only 8.7k units but
**925k unverified pairs** (the generated-twin clusters; those units are lossy-lowered
and `exact_safe = false` product-side, so they are *low* campaign value despite the
mass).

**Campaign order this fixes:** (1) uninterpreted-function handling for opaque calls
and field reads — evaluate them as symbolic applications/projections recorded in the
ordered effect trace, rather than bailing the whole unit; structure-keyed, so it
survives lowering drift (§BC–BF). (2) Statement coverage that rides on it (Throw/Try).
(3) Deprioritize unretained-literal units: their merges are already outside the exact
channel.

Side product (modality A for the detection campaign): the per-repo `--leads` pass
merged into `bench/labels/oracle_under_merge_leads_2026_06_10.json` — **179
behavior-equal fingerprint-split groups, 5 structurally near (vj ≥ 0.7)**, e.g.
nginx's `http` vs `stream` geo modules and sympy's `matrices/common` vs `matrixbase`
duplicates — oracle-proven missed clones, the strongest convergence leads available.

### BL.1 — uninterpreted symbolic values: the census-ordered extension, measured

The campaign's first move (the census's #1 and #2 targets at once): opaque calls and
unproven field reads now interpret as **identified symbolic values** instead of bailing
the unit. An opaque call evaluates its arguments, yields `Sym(callee-signature ⊕
argument values)`, and records itself in the ordered effect trace; field reads become
symbolic projections; every composition (bin/un/index/eager builtins/HoF/reduce/append/
nullish) keeps symbolic operands symbolic via a deep `contains_sym` guard — never
laundering unknownness into a concrete `Err` — and control flow over a `Sym` still
bails. The convention is differential: same opaque operations on equal operands in the
same order ⟹ equal traces. Because symbolic identity keys on pre-canon syntax, a
Sym-bearing disagreement goes to a new **advisory lane**, never the hard SOUND gate;
canon preservation and the completeness/leads direction stay concrete-only (a symbolic
behavior-equality is too weak a missed-clone witness).

Same sharded corpus pass (104 repos, raylib #208 excluded), before → after
(`oracle_exclusion_census_2026_06_10.json` → `…_post_symbolic_2026_06_10.json`):

| | baseline | symbolic | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| interpretable units | 26,382 (4.5%) | **173,874 (29.4%)** | ×6.6 |
| oracle-verified merge pairs | 316,677 (9.2%) | **1,077,871 (31.3%)** | ×3.4 |
| unverified merge mass | 90.8% | **68.7%** | −22.1pp |

The advisory lane surfaced **1,276** symbolic-trace disagreements to review (expected:
AC-canonicalized operand order legitimately differs pre-canon). The hard lane is *not*
clean — and that is a pre-existing finding, not a symbolic artifact: 17 repos flag
fingerprint-equal pairs with concretely different behavior (e.g. `black`'s
try/import-wrapper colliding with `return self` on a degenerate 2-node fingerprint),
reproducing identically on the pre-symbolic binary and on `origin/main` back to at
least 517ad5c. Filed as #210 (the exact channel is protected by `exact_safe`; the
`near` value-accept path is exposed). The remaining census leaders after this round:
`lit:unretained:Other` stays product-irrelevant (lossy-lowered), and the residual
battery-bail mass concentrates in branch-on-symbolic units (`kind:If` excl-share 92%) —
i.e. the next coverage unit is symbolic-condition path exploration, a much harder
step deliberately not taken at the time (control flow is never guessed). *Taken,
boundedly, in §BU (#244): both arms explored under recorded assumptions — conditioned,
not guessed — with a fail-closed site cap.*

### BL.2 — raylib verify budget: bound the oracle, don't hang it

Issue #208 exposed a verify-only performance path: `nose verify bench/repos/raylib` exceeded a
120s local timeout even though normal scanning completed. Sampling showed two costs compounding:
the oracle rebuilt file-level value-graph context for every unit, then ran the full input battery
against large C functions.

The fix mirrors detector extraction by sharing one `ValueFingerprintContext` per file and adds a
unit work cap before value fingerprinting or interpretation. A unit whose
`IL node count × battery rows > 384000` is excluded as `battery-bail`; this is a fail-closed
coverage loss, not a guessed equivalence.

Measured on 2026-06-10 against local raylib:

| command | before | after |
|---|---:|---:|
| `nose verify bench/repos/raylib` | >120s timeout | 62.8s |

The after run on top of the symbolic-oracle baseline reported 8182 total units, 1735
interpretable units, and 18 oversized `battery-bail` exclusions. It also surfaced two
pre-existing value-fingerprint false-merge leads and one
canon-preservation lead in raylib; #208 intentionally does not mask them with exclusions because
the product semantic scan did not report those targeted pairs, and the point of `verify` is to
make such soundness leads visible once the oracle is tractable.

## BM. Near on the default scan surface — price the locked +8pp recall

§BJ measured the biggest proven recall gap in today's product: the shipped but opt-in
`near` channel lifts worthy-recall by about eight points. This experiment prices the
product decision rather than assuming the answer: keep the current CLI default
(`syntax,semantic`), add unthresholded `near`, or adopt a thresholded middle.

**Method.** `bench/labels/near_default_surface_experiment.py` scans all 105 v5 repos
with four arms: default, `syntax,semantic,near`, `syntax,semantic,near:0.8`, and
`syntax,semantic,near:0.85`. P@10 uses the native `nose scan --format json` order
(`extractability`); worthy-recall is over worthy v5 labels; noise is the
`ranking.surface_counts.default` delta plus family `scope` splits from full `--top 0`
JSON. Artifact: `bench/labels/near_default_surface_2026_06_10.json`. Held-out was
not tuned; the threshold arms are reported as candidate policies, not selected by
fitting held-out.

### BM.3 — reviewer-burden proxy

| arm | default-surface families | delta | prod delta | test delta | mixed delta | review delta | hidden delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| default | 66919 | +0 | +0 | +0 | +0 | +0 | +0 |
| near | 81725 | +14806 | +10768 | +3295 | +743 | -121 | -206 |
| near:0.80 | 81523 | +14604 | +9485 | +4564 | +555 | -125 | -294 |
| near:0.85 | 79356 | +12437 | +8485 | +3437 | +515 | -158 | -463 |

**Verdict: flip the default channel mix to include unthresholded `near`, but do it as a
separate product change with release/docs migration notes.** The held-out gate does
not show a material P@10 drop; it improves from 55.5% to 58.6% while worthy-recall
jumps from 88.5% to 96.7%. The thresholded middle is not a good trade: `near:0.80`
keeps almost all the default-surface burden (+14.6k vs +14.8k) while giving back
three points of held-out recall, and `near:0.85` saves only another ~2.2k default
families while giving back more than half the recall gain.

The cost is real: unthresholded `near` adds 14,806 default-surface families across the
corpus (+22.1%), mostly production-scope (+10,768) with a large test-scope tail
(+3,295). That argues for making the flip explicit rather than silent. But
[design](design.md) §2's primary consumer is an LLM agent that wants high recall and
can filter/rerank; perfect worthiness separation in the scanner is lower leverage for
that consumer. With no held-out precision hit and a measured +8.2pp held-out
worthy-recall gain, keeping `near` opt-in would leave proven useful candidates behind
the flag that the primary consumer is least likely to remember.

### BM.4 — the flip, shipped + post-flip sanity re-run (#241, 2026-06-11)

The verdict was executed in #241: `nose scan`'s default is now
`syntax,semantic,near` (an explicit `--mode`/config `mode` still replaces it;
`nose review`'s default deliberately stays `syntax,semantic` — review feeds a
gate, and this experiment priced the scan surface only). Post-flip sanity on the
then-current binary (post-§BP/§BQ, so absolute numbers differ from the BM.1–BM.2
tables), default arm vs pinned `--mode syntax,semantic`
(`bench/labels/near_default_flip_sanity_2026_06_11.txt`):

| arm | split | P@10 | worthy-recall |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| `syntax,semantic` (old default) | dev | 59% [54–64] | 86.3% |
| default (flipped) | dev | 58% [54–64] | 95.2% |
| `syntax,semantic` (old default) | heldout | 52% [47–58] | 88.7% |
| default (flipped) | heldout | 55% [49–60] | **96.9%** |

The §BM direction reproduces exactly: held-out worthy-recall +8.2pp, held-out
P@10 +3pp (within CI), dev P@10 flat. CI/baseline migration notes are in the
CHANGELOG entry.

## BN. Ruby test-DSL blocks — turn invisible test bodies into block units

Issue #214 investigated the Ruby no-overlapping-unit misses left by §BJ. The
common failure mode was not semantic matching; it was unit extraction. Minitest and
RSpec-style tests are method calls whose block bodies are function-shaped review
units, but the Ruby frontend only kept the call/lambda structure as nested values,
so the scanner had no unit rooted at the test body.

Representative evidence before the change:

| repo | location | observed pattern |
|---|---|---|
| `asciidoctor` | `test/tables_test.rb:1560` and `:1601` | two `test '...' do` bodies with duplicated setup/assertion shape |
| `fastlane` | `spaceship/spec/client_spec.rb:147` and `:218` | repeated `describe 'retry' do` blocks with nested examples |
| `rubocop` | `spec/rubocop/cop/style/infinite_loop_spec.rb:6` and `:23` | parameterized `it "registers..." do` examples inside `%w(...).each` |

The implementation is intentionally conservative: when a Ruby call's method name is
in a test-DSL allowlist (`test`, `it`, `specify`, `example`, `describe`, `context`,
`feature`, `scenario`, shared-example/context hooks, and setup/teardown hooks), the
frontend emits the existing lambda body as a `Block` unit named from the method and
first literal label argument, for example `it:adds values`. Generic iterator blocks
such as `.each do` remain values only.

### BN.1 — recall-ceiling probe

Artifact: `bench/labels/ruby_test_dsl_recovery_2026_06_10.json`. The after probe
uses the same v5 labels as §BJ and fixes `recall_ceiling_probe.py --repos-root`
handling so worktree-local probes still classify members against the shared corpus
root.

| metric | before | after | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Ruby `no-overlapping-unit` misses | 21 | 2 | -19 |
| Ruby arm1 missed worthy labels | 55 | 41 | -14 |
| Ruby arm1 recall, dev | 343/380 (90.3%) | 352/380 (92.6%) | +2.4pp |
| Ruby arm1 recall, held-out | 232/250 (92.8%) | 237/250 (94.8%) | +2.0pp |
| Overall arm1 recall, dev | 94.3% | 94.9% | +0.6pp |
| Overall arm1 recall, held-out | 96.4% | 96.7% | +0.3pp |

The remaining two Ruby `no-overlapping-unit` misses are not test-DSL cases: one is
an extensionless Jekyll benchmark script, and one is a Sidekiq bin-script pair.
They need a different unit-coverage decision.

### BN.2 — default product metric

The default scan surface is unchanged by this fix, because the new units recover
candidate bodies for maximal/near recall without adding new default-surface families
in the measured corpus. Full `eval_by_language.py --rank extractability --top 0`
after the change matched the §BM default baseline:

| split | overall P@10 | Ruby P@10 | Ruby worthy recall |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| dev | 63% [58-68] n=353 | 84% [70-95] n=37 | 294/380 |
| held-out | 56% [50-61] n=308 | 84% [68-96] n=25 | 180/250 |

### BN.3 — Ruby extraction cost

Measured across the 15 Ruby corpus repos with `NOSE_TIME_UNIT_SUMMARY=1`:

| Ruby corpus scan metric | before | after | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| units seen | 7479 | 12283 | +4804 |
| units kept | 3377 | 5705 | +2328 |
| blocks kept | 1179 | 3338 | +2159 |
| unit extraction time | 712.9ms | 959.4ms | +246.5ms |
| candidate families | 2985 | 2985 | 0 |
| default-surface families | 2865 | 2865 | 0 |

Wall-clock scan timing in the ad hoc run was cache-order noisy, but showed no obvious
regression. The stable cost signal is extraction work: about 247ms extra over the
Ruby corpus, with no candidate-family or default-surface expansion. Verdict: keep
the allowlisted Ruby test-DSL block units. They remove the dominant Ruby unit-blind
spot from the recall-ceiling probe without harming the default product metric.

## BO. Rust `macro_rules!` arms — expose token-tree bodies without semantic overclaiming

Issue #215 tested the second named unit-extraction gap from §BJ: Rust macro bodies,
especially `clap`'s `clap_builder/src/macros.rs`, where duplicated `macro_rules!`
arms were invisible because macro definitions only contributed a shadowing marker.

The feasibility answer is mixed but useful. `tree-sitter-rust` exposes each
`macro_rules!` arm as a `macro_rule` with `left` and `right` fields, but the RHS is
a `token_tree`, not a parsed Rust statement/expression tree. The implementation
therefore extracts each RHS as a named `Block` unit (`macro_name:armN`) containing
one `Raw("macro_rule_body")` boundary plus identifier/literal atoms. That keeps the
unit matchable by syntax/near, while `exact_safe=false` prevents the semantic exact
channel from claiming runtime equivalence for token soup.

### BO.1 — recall-ceiling probe

Artifact: `bench/labels/rust_macro_rules_recovery_2026_06_10.json`.

| metric | before | after | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Rust `no-overlapping-unit` misses | 14 | 9 | -5 |
| Rust arm1 missed worthy labels | 57 | 52 | -5 |
| Rust arm1 recall, dev | 364/411 (88.6%) | 369/411 (89.8%) | +1.2pp |
| Rust arm1 recall, held-out | 245/255 (96.1%) | 245/255 (96.1%) | +0.0pp |
| Overall arm1 recall, dev | 94.9% | 95.1% | +0.2pp |
| Overall arm1 recall, held-out | 96.7% | 96.7% | +0.0pp |

The recovered labels are the `macro_rules!` arm-definition shape, led by the
`clap` `arg_impl!` arms. The remaining Rust `no-overlapping-unit` records are
not all the same shape: large single-arm macro definitions (`nushell`), macro
invocation bodies (`regex` `ffi_fn!`, `ripgrep` `rgtest!`, Tokio test macros),
top-level constant/import spans, and ordinary unit-size/window gaps remain.
Those need separate, more conservative decisions.

### BO.2 — default product metric

Full default `eval_by_language.py --rank extractability --top 0` after the change
did not move the product P@10 gate:

| split | overall P@10 | Rust P@10 | Rust worthy recall |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| dev | 63% [58-68] n=353 | 77% [65-88] n=57 | 318/411 |
| held-out | 56% [50-61] n=308 | 62% [50-74] n=58 | 227/255 |

Default worthy recall is essentially unchanged because these units are exact-unsafe
token-tree units. They mainly help the maximal/near recall probe and make macro-arm
duplication visible for review.

### BO.3 — Rust extraction surface

Measured across the 15 Rust corpus repos:

| Rust corpus scan metric | before | after | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| units kept | 93948 | 94507 | +559 |
| macro-arm units kept | 0 | 356 | +356 |
| candidate families | 4819 | 4826 | +7 |
| default-surface families | 4782 | 4789 | +7 |
| scan wall time sum | 5.808s | 5.860s | +0.052s |
| features wall time sum | 17.482s | 17.759s | +0.277s |

The new macro-arm units have exactly one raw boundary each. Their measured raw ratio
is not "mostly Raw": median 0.0667, mean 0.0634, max 0.125, with median token count
15 and range 8-145. The cost is small but nonzero: +7 default-surface families over
the Rust corpus. Verdict: keep `macro_rules!` arm units, but do not generalize to all
macro invocation bodies in this issue. The remaining Rust no-overlap records should
be handled as separate coverage questions because their blast radius is broader than
arm definitions.

## BP. The degenerate-fingerprint campaign — five erasure classes, a claim-scoped gate

The #193 oracle pass left 17 corpus repos flagging fingerprint-equal pairs with
concretely different behavior (#210). Chasing every pair to root cause found **five
distinct erasure classes** — each one a construct silently contributing *nothing* to the
value multiset, so "code that does X" fingerprinted like "code that doesn't":

1. **Python `try/except/else` dropped the `else` clause at lowering** (and Ruby routed
   `else` into handler position, where the no-throw convention erases it): black's
   try/import/else wrapper ≡ `return self`. Else statements now fold into the try body —
   they run exactly when the body completes without raising.
2. **C/Go/Rust lowered dereference STORE targets transparently** (`(*nr)++` became the
   dead local rebind `nr = nr + 1`): git's `inc_nr` callback merged with every
   `return 0` stub — 38 pairs in git alone, plus nginx/curl/minio/redis. A store
   target's deref now lowers as the computed place `Index(p, 0)`; deref *reads* keep
   peeling so `*x > 0` still converges with `x > 0`.
3. **The oracle's 2-arg scalar min/max fell into the 1-arg collection fold** on a List
   operand (`max([1,2,3,4], 7)` returned 4): the proof-backed 3-way selection canon
   (if-chain ≡ `Math.max` chain) was flagged as a false merge on commons-lang — an
   instrument bug, the merge was sound.
4. **Go type-switch cases (`type_case` nodes) lowered to an empty block**: hugo's
   recursive type-switch traversal fingerprinted identically to a constant stub — at
   exact-safe, length 10, a *reportable* exact-channel merge. Arms now survive under a
   raw test keyed by the case's type spelling.
5. **Three fidelity refinements**: try-handler erasure narrowed to provably
   non-throwing bodies (the pinned `return 1` convention survives; `try {return x+1}
   except {return x}` keeps its handler under an exception guard); element-free effects
   under a loop keyed by the loop's canonical element source (for-in over keys vs
   for-of over values no longer collide — prettier); and the oracle binds battery rows
   under each parameter's DECLARED type domain, the §BC–BF convention extended to types
   (a typed `int` never receives a List, so rxjava's order-swapped typed field writes
   stop flagging on impossible type-states).

**The gate is now scoped to the claim.** Hard violations require the *product's* exact
surface on both sides (`exact_claim_eligible`: strict-exact-safe + the
`EXACT_VALUE_MIN` degenerate-size floor — the same two gates the exact channel and the
near value-accept already apply); collisions between lossy fingerprints are a
diagnostics lane, and symbolic-trace or declaration-divergent disagreements (units
whose declared domains differ are not battery-comparable row-for-row) are advisory
leads. **Result: `nose verify` reports SOUND — zero hard violations — on all 105
corpus repos**, including raylib for the first time (§BM-era work bounded its oracle
cost). Known residuals stay visible, not buried: same-spelling opaque calls inside
lossy fingerprints (the delve fixture class) sit in the diagnostics lane, and labeled
`break` erasure (`break outer` lowers like plain `break`) is noted as a follow-up.

**Recall/precision cost: zero.** An apples-to-apples v5 eval against the pre-campaign
binary on the same corpus shows identical P@10 (53% [48–58] dev / 55% [50–60] heldout,
both arms, per-language rows unchanged) with heldout worthy-recall *up* four labels
(Go +3, Python +1) — the erasure fixes split only behaviorally-different pairs, and
representing deref effects let a few previously stub-collapsed units group correctly.

## BQ. The evidence-index campaign — the quadratic scans behind `normalize+extract`

`NOSE_TIME=1` stage timing on the corpus showed `normalize+extract` at 95–97% of
scan cost (sympy: 20.5s of a 21s scan; redis: 6.9s of 7.4s), and the per-pass
`NOSE_TIME_NORMALIZE` aggregation put 92% of the normalize half in the four
evidence passes — call-target 35.6s, binding 14.3s, effect 21.7s, api 1.8s CPU
on sympy. The shape was always the same: **a per-node/per-call query running a
full linear scan of `il.evidence` (or `il.nodes`)** — O(n²) on evidence-dense
files. The span-keyed evidence index existed (`Il::evidence_anchored_at`), but
most consumers predated it.

What landed, all output-preserving (byte-identical scan JSON on
redis/git/tokio/guava/sympy/netty and the full test suite before/after):

1. **Every anchored evidence query goes through the index.**
   `find_or_push_builtin_evidence` (the emit-path dedup scan — quadratic on
   its own output), both evidence `upsert`s, the call-target/binding/library-api
   pass helpers, and ~15 anchored scans in `nose-semantics` now query the
   span bucket. `EvidenceIndex` gained a `by_binding_hash` bucket for the
   `Binding`-anchor-by-hash consumers and a `(id, span)` staleness sentinel so a
   `clear()`/`retain()`+re-push rebuilds instead of silently corrupting
   (a latent hazard a unit test exposed the moment more paths used the index).
2. **Two more lazy arena indexes on `Il`,** under the same nodes-are-immutable
   discipline as `scope_index`: `nodes_spanning` (span → nodes; kills the
   whole-arena `node_at_span*` scans in library-api span queries) and
   `assigns_in_scope` (nearest-scope → assigns; kills the whole-arena scan in
   `unique_binding_lhs_for_var_reference`, which ran per Var reference).
3. **`binding_evidence` inverted its mutation walk.** Per-binding
   `visit_scope_nodes` (O(assignments × scope size)) became one
   `ScopeMutationFacts` walk per scope harvesting names per site, with the
   shadow rule applied via per-nested-scope bound-name sets — same verdicts,
   one pass (sympy: 14.3s → 0.8s).
4. **The pure-inline registry is file-level, not per-unit.** `units::extract`
   rebuilt it per unit — every unit re-walked every function body
   (O(units × file), ~17s CPU on sympy, the dominant *block*-unit cost).
   `ValueFingerprintContext` now collects `InlineCandidate`s once per file with
   the safety check's global-name requirements *recorded* instead of resolved;
   per-unit admission (self-exclusion + required-globals ⊆ the unit's seeded
   `global_env`, snapshotted at adopt time) moved to the call site, and call
   resolution inverted from per-registry-entry evidence checks to one
   `direct_function_call_target_span_at_call` + span lookup. The context-free
   path shares the same mechanism (the old `inline_fns` map is gone).

**Result** (release, 10-core M-series, default `syntax,semantic` scan): sympy
20.0 → 4.7s wall (81.3 → 23.5s CPU), redis 3.9 → 1.0s, git 2.7 → 1.1s, netty
3.5 → 1.8s, guava 3.6 → 2.2s, tokio 0.5 → 0.3s — **2–4× end-to-end** with
byte-identical output. The dogfood gate caught one real near-duplicate the
refactor itself introduced (`path_cond`/`guarded` converged once both used the
same indexed loop) — deduped by making `guarded` call `path_cond`, count back
at 24.

The remaining cost after this campaign is the genuine per-unit value-graph
build (blocks dominate by count), no longer accidental quadratics. The design
lesson matches §T: hot-path evidence/node lookups must be index-backed by
default — a raw `il.evidence`/`il.nodes` iteration in a per-node helper is a
red flag in review.

## BR. Divergent-edit fire-precision benchmark — consumer 2 gets its first measurement

[design](design.md) §3 raised "divergent-edit gate: harden it past v1 and define a
conservative fire policy" — but nothing measured the gate product itself: the v5
labelset owns the historical product-query surface, and §BG measured hazard *ranking*, not whether
`nose query . base=<parent>` fires correctly on a real change stream. #243 built that measurement
(`eval/divergence_fire/replay.py`): replay query base at 25 sampled
first-parent commits in each of 14 corpus repos (7 languages × dev/heldout) — the
working tree holds the merged change, exactly the PR-gate situation — in two arms
(default `syntax,semantic`, and `+near`). Labeling unit: a fired change's
**top-ranked finding** (`--fail` is a per-change decision); 120 findings, §BG-gold
method — judge labels, then two adversarial refuters on every positive, a positive
survives only if both sustain.

**Result** (artifacts `eval/divergence_fire/{replay_summary,verdicts}_2026_06_11.*`,
narrative [eval/divergence_fire/RESULTS.md](../eval/divergence_fire/RESULTS.md)): the default
arm fires on **33.1%** of replayed merged changes (near arm 41.2%) at **4.2%** strict
top-1 precision (default 3.1%, near 5.5%). The five confirmed positives are three
unique, externally-validated misses — rubocop's `DataInheritance#correct_parent`
autocorrect bug (still latent upstream), rxjs's missing `AnimationFrameAction` guard
(**upstream later merged the equivalent fix, rxjs #7444, citing the same root
cause**), and tokio #7675 fixing five identical socket `Debug` impls but missing
`UdpSocket`. The false-fire taxonomy is the #245 gap list: **51%
`no_propagation_needed`** — the diff overlaps the member's *span* but not the
*shared logic* (the old overlap test is span-level; requiring overlap with the
family's shared/invariant lines targets exactly this bucket), 32% intentional
divergence (variant pairs — an ignore/ergonomics problem, not a threshold), 12%
not-a-clone (grouping artifacts).

Two reads. The gate problem is **dilution, not absence**: real un-propagated changes
exist in the wild at a useful rate (3 in 350 merged changes) and query-base ordering
put them at top-1 — but a 33–41% fire rate at ~4% precision means `--fail` must stay
an explicitly-opted, policy-tuned gate ("a gate that cries wolf gets disabled" is now
a measured fact). And half the noise is one mechanical bucket, so the first #245
policy lever (shared-line overlap) is cheap and targeted, not judgment-deep. Protocol
limits recorded in RESULTS.md: top-1 only, 14 repos, and merged-PR replay sees only
the surviving change stream. A side catch: `--format json|sarif` printed a human
sentence on empty reviewable diffs (adds-only PRs) — fixed in #252.

## BS. Behavior-keyed miss mining — the vj<0.8 frontier, measured (go/no-go: NO-GO)

§BK's structural arm is blind below vj 0.8 by construction; #246 built the
complementary behavior-keyed arm (`bench/type4/behavior_miss_mining.py`) — §AU's
"oracle as generator" executed: candidates come from `nose verify --leads`
(units grouped by concrete battery behavior, under-merged groups exported with
their max-vj cross-fingerprint pair), so structure plays no part in candidate
generation. Run on all 105 corpus repos on the post-§BP/§BQ binary (raylib
included for the first time; zero mining failures), then classified: span/size
via file-scoped `nose features`, unreported = no maximal-surface
(`syntax,semantic,near --min-value 0`) family co-reports the pair, trivial =
below the 5-line/24-token product floor.

**Result** (`bench/type4/behavior_miss_mining_2026_06_11.json`): 163 leads
corpus-wide → **11** unreported non-trivial vj<0.8 pairs (5 Go, 5 C, 1 Python;
10 of 11 at text-similarity < 0.5). Judge + adversarial-refuter labeling of all
11 (`behavior_miss_verdicts_2026_06_11.jsonl`): **10 battery artifacts** —
agreement only on degenerate battery behavior (both echo the input, both
return 0/false/reject on non-matching inputs, both hit empty-input fast
paths) while the success branches compute unrelated things — and **one genuine
worthy miss**, refuter-sustained: redis `deps/hiredis/sds.c`
`hi_sdsll2str` ↔ `hi_sdsull2str` (vj 0.33), token-identical digit-emit/reverse
helpers whose own comment says "Identical …, but for unsigned long long type";
redis's mainline `ll2string` already ships the merged form this pair refactors
to. (Why even near misses it: vj 0.33 is far below value-accept and the sign
branch changes the shape enough to split candidates — and at text 0.88 it is
not even the deep-Type-4 shape this arm was hunting.)

**Verdict — NO-GO for a recall mechanism, the §BJ discipline answer.** The
oracle-visible different-algorithm Type-4 frontier is one worthy pair per 105
repos; everything else the behavior key surfaces is degenerate-agreement noise.
Combined with §BJ (sub-DAG ceiling 0.6–2.0%) and §BK (~600 mostly-scaffolding
pairs at vj ≥ 0.8), every measured recall frontier is now small: worthy-recall
is bounded by unit extraction and judgment, not by missing matching machinery.
Instrument limits, stated: only interpretable units participate (~29% of units,
concrete-trace lane; §BL.1), and each behavior group contributes one
representative pair — so this measures the *oracle-visible* frontier, not the
absolute one. The cheap re-run path when #244 widens the oracle (symbolic-
condition path exploration raises interpretable coverage): re-run `mine` —
the arm is corpus-pinned, deterministic, and now ~30 minutes wall.

## BT. Collection-kind closure — the L5/L6 audit, and the Ruby for-in/shovel residue

#247 set out to "close the L5/L6 builder-loop exact-channel asymmetry" — and the
first finding was that **most of it had already shipped** in the semantic-kernel
tranche, with `bench/type4/coverage_leads.md`'s body text stale against its own
✅ headers: Go's composite-literal kinds are distinguished at lowering (`array` /
map / `go_struct`), Go functional append and Java's import-proven
`new ArrayList` + `.add` both converge with the comprehension form, each locked by
equivalence tests with struct/unimported/shadowed hard negatives. Ruby `each`/`map`
on bare receivers stay closed **by design** (no Enumerable inference from a method
name — a pack supplies receiver proof). The audit-then-implement shape mattered:
the issue as written would have rebuilt existing machinery.

The genuine residue was Ruby's receiver-proof-free path, and it was two small
defects deep:

1. **Every Ruby `for` loop was out of the exact channel**: tree-sitter-ruby wraps
   the iterable in an `in` node (`for x in xs` → `value: (in (identifier))`), and
   `lower_for` lowered the wrapper — an exact-unsafe `Raw("in")` that also blocked
   `Elem(xs)` recognition. Fixed at the frontend (lower the wrapped expression).
2. **The shovel had no sound admission path**: `out << e` is `BinOp(Shl)` — shift
   on integers, append on arrays, anything on objects. `ruby_shovel_append_parts`
   (nose-semantics) now recognizes the *form only*; admission rides the existing
   active-builder proof — the receiver must be seeded by a proven empty list
   literal, the same `ActiveCollectionBuilder` contract the method form uses. An
   integer-seeded `<<` stays a shift; a parameter receiver never builds.

Result: Ruby `out = []; for x in xs; out << x*x; end; out` is exact-safe and
fingerprint-identical to the Python comprehension/builder loop (and the bare
ruby `for` ≡ python `for`). Validation per the standing discipline: equivalence
tests + 3 adjacent hard negatives (different contribution / integer shift /
unproven parameter receiver); `nose verify` SOUND + canon PRESERVED on
rubocop/fastlane/sidekiq/jekyll/asciidoctor; maximal-surface scan diff across 7
Ruby corpus repos: **zero locations lost, zero gained** — idiomatic Ruby uses
`each`, so the axis closes the §4b cross-language `exact_safe` evenness gap, not
a corpus-recall gap (the §BO macro-arm shape). Builder ≡ comprehension now holds
in the exact channel for python/js/ts/rust/go/java + ruby-for-in; C has no
comparable idiom.

## BU. Bounded symbolic-condition path exploration — conditioned, never guessed

The §BL census's top residual — branch-on-symbolic units (`kind:If` excl-share
92%) — named a step deliberately not taken: control flow is never guessed. #244
takes it without guessing: when an If/ternary condition evaluates to a symbolic
value, the oracle now explores BOTH arms (depth-first, true-arm first,
deterministic), recording each assumption in the effect trace as a `Sym` marker
(`assume ⊕ cond ⊕ arm`). The decision is *conditioned*, not guessed: two units
compare equal only when their assumptions AND outcomes align. Three design locks:

- **advisory by construction** — the assume marker keeps every explored path's
  behavior symbolic, so a cross-unit disagreement involving an explored path can
  only ever reach the advisory lane (`has_sym`), never the hard SOUND gate; canon
  preservation likewise stays concrete-only (canonicalization may merge the very
  branches exploration forks on);
- **fail-closed cap** — at most 3 symbolic decision sites per execution (≤ 8
  paths per battery row); past it the unit bails as a new, census-visible
  `path-bail` (2,101 units corpus-wide). While/ForEach conditions stay strict —
  an assumption per iteration is an unbounded chain, not a bounded fork;
- **the strict contract is untouched** — `run_unit` (canon validation, the
  fragment oracle) still bails on a symbolic condition; only `nose verify`'s
  battery uses the exploring `run_unit_paths`.

**Result** (105-repo census, both binaries, same corpus:
`oracle_exclusion_census_post_paths_2026_06_11.json`; verify **SOUND on all
105 repos**, canon PRESERVED, raylib within its §BL.2 budget):

| | pre-#244 | post-#244 | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| interpretable units | 174,881 (29.2%) | 187,650 (31.3%) | **+12,769 (+2.1pp)** |
| verified merge pairs | 1,073,454 (31.5%) | 1,076,080 (31.6%) | +2,626 (+0.1pp) |
| path-bail (fail-closed, visible) | — | 2,101 | |

**The honest read is double-edged.** The instrument gain is real — ~12.8k units
that bailed on a symbolic branch now interpret, and the behavior-keyed mining arm
(§BS) gets a wider candidate source for its cheap re-runs. But the *pair-mass*
needle barely moves: the unverified 68.5% → 68.4%. The §BL attribution listed
`kind:If` at 92% excl-share, yet conditioning on branches recovers only 0.1pp of
pair mass — i.e. the units behind the unverified bulk are excluded for SEVERAL
reasons at once (opaque statements, unsupported shapes, sheer size), and no single
construct unlock will move it. That refines the campaign order the census set in
§BL: the remaining oracle-completeness work is broad-spectrum statement coverage,
not another control-flow mechanism — and given §BS measured the frontier this
instrument feeds at one worthy pair per 105 repos, further oracle-completeness
investment should wait for a consumer that needs it.

## BV. The conservative divergent-edit fire policy — measured, shipped as the `--fail` default

§BR gave the gate its labelset (120 refuter-confirmed top-1 findings; 5 genuine
should-propagate) and its gap list (51% of false fires = span overlap without
shared-logic contact). #245 turns that into the `--fail` policy. Query base now
computes, per changed member, whether the diff PROVABLY touches lines the member
shares with an un-updated sibling — two proof shapes keyed on the family's
equivalence witness: an `exact-value-graph` family's whole span is shared by the
channel's own proof (equal value fingerprints retain literal values; the typical
exact clone is a renamed twin whose every line differs textually — a line diff
would under-fire exactly on the strongest families), while fuzzy and token
families subtract the member's varying spots (the token channel abstracts
identifiers/literals, so a `copy-paste-run` member may legitimately vary in
exactly those spots). Unknown (unreadable source, capped spot list) is
not-eligible: the gate fires on proof, never on absence of one. Query JSON gains
`fire_eligible` / `witness_kind` / `scope` per finding and `touches_shared` per
changed site.

**Measured on the §BR labels** (re-replay with policy fields, joined 120/120 by
changed-site span; `eval/divergence_fire/policy_eval_2026_06_11.json`):

| policy | fires (n=120) | true positives kept | precision |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| any (pre-#245 `--fail`) | 120 | 5/5 | 4.2% |
| touches-shared (line proof) | 64 | **5/5** | 7.8% |
| exact-witness only | 4 | 0/5 | 0% |
| **shipped: (line ∨ exact-witness) ∧ scope ≠ test** | **32** | **5/5** | **15.6%** |

Every true positive survives every tier — a real propagation hazard by
definition touches shared logic — so the policy is pure noise reduction: 73%
fewer fires at 3.7× the precision. Change-level, the gate now fires on 15% of
replayed merged changes (was 33%) on review's default mix. The exact-witness
fast path is measured-neutral on this sample (its 4 fires were all judged
intentional/no-propagation) but stays for correctness on renamed twins, locked
by the `review_flags_a_clone_changed_in_one_copy_only` fixture. `--fail-on any`
restores span-overlap firing for ratchet-style use.

Honest limits: 16% precision is a measured floor on THIS labelset (top-1
findings only, 14 repos, no held-out split), not a precision claim; the
remaining false fires are §BR's judgment classes (intentional variants,
not-a-clone grouping artifacts) where structured ignores and family-quality
work are the levers, not more gate logic. The §BG-gold3 ordering result also
closes here: all 5 positives sat at rank 0 under review's existing
priority/complexity ordering on this labelset — the post-divergence ordering
already works; the gate needed precision, not better ranking (#23's answer).

## BW. Re-sweeping two shelved knobs — one stays shelved, one yields a usable knob

#248 executed the §AY discipline (re-sweep old blockers when the system improves)
on the two smallest parked items.

**Num-gated doubling (`x*2 ≡ x+x`) — still rejected, now with corpus evidence.**
§AY rejected it for verify cost, §BA for cross-language soundness (the canonical
form depends on operands proving Num — since supplied by `ValueDomain`). Before
re-implementing, the §BS behavior-keyed instrument gave a prevalence check the
original attempts never had: across all 163 corpus-wide behavior-equal
fingerprint-split leads, **zero** pairs are split by the doubling representation
(4 textual `x+x`/`2*x` matches, all in battery-artifact pairs of unrelated
computations). Doubling is precisely the numeric shape the oracle interprets
best, so the instrument's blind spot argument is weak here. Verdict: the idiom
splits nothing real; rejected without re-implementation — the re-sweep's value
is the evidence trail.

**The §BJ 8–20 anchor-mass band — measured, knob shipped, default kept.**
`NOSE_ANCHOR_MIN_WEIGHT` (research surface, like `NOSE_ANCHOR_SCORE*`) now
overrides the anchor weight floor; the never-run §BJ sweep ran at 20/16/12/8
(105 repos, native order):

| floor | dev P@10 | dev recall | heldout P@10 | heldout recall |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 20 (default) | 58% [54–64] | 95.2% | 55% [49–60] | 96.9% |
| 16 | 58% [53–63] | 95.4% | 54% [48–59] | 97.1% |
| 12 | 61% [56–66] | 95.7% | 54% [48–59] | 97.3% |
| 8 | 60% [55–65] | 96.6% | 55% [49–60] | **97.8%** |

The recall gain is real and monotone (+1.4pp dev / +0.9pp held-out at floor 8)
with P@10 flat across overlapping CIs — and on corpus repos the default surface
CONSOLIDATES (more shared anchors merge related families: netty 4,882 → 3,120
total) at a 5–15% scan-time cost. §BJ's "weak refactor targets" expectation was
half wrong. The other half was right where it bites: on the near-only gate
surface, nose's own dup-gate jumps 24 → 73 "substantial" families — the band IS
dense in small real-but-marginal near-duplicates, and the dogfood budget is a
never-loosen ratchet. **Verdict: default stays 20; the knob ships.** A
recall-first consumer (design §2's agent) can set `NOSE_ANCHOR_MIN_WEIGHT=8` for
+0.9pp held-out worthy-recall at no measured precision cost; gate-shaped
surfaces keep the conservative floor.

## BX. The agent recipe, validated the #227 way — and sharpened by its own failures

#249 closes the consumer-1 loop the #227 audit opened: scan JSON now carries the
evidence (witness #230, varying spots #231, generated markers #232, enclosing
names #233), and [docs/agent-recipe.md](agent-recipe.md) is the protocol an LLM
agent follows to act on it — field reading order, the v5 rubric's core question,
verdict actions (propose / structured-ignore / leave), and the #245 gate fields
for PR-time findings.

**Validation** (artifact `bench/labels/agent_recipe_validation_2026_06_11.json`):
3 repos (clap, sympy, netty) × top-10 default-surface families on the current
binary; a judge agent followed the recipe with the family JSON ONLY (no source
access — that is the point), span-matched against the v5 labels (19 of 30
sampled families are in the v5 pool; the rest are post-pool surface). Round 1:
**12/19 (63%)** agreement, with a clear under-call bias (6 of 7 errors judged
worthy families not-worthy) in two patterns — example/fixture-directory families
dismissed by location, and near-identical per-variant siblings (covariant return
types) mislabeled `parallel-by-design`. Both are calibrations the v5 RUBRIC
already states; the recipe gained two explicit step-6 bullets. Round 2 (fresh
agent, sharpened recipe): **14/19 (74%)**, worthy-recall within the sample
7/13 → **12/13**, over-calls up 1 → 4. The five residual disagreements are
trivial-vs-extract-base borderline calls on small sibling families — the
§AV judgment-deep shape, where the human labels themselves needed a 3-persona
panel.

Honest limits: one tuning iteration on this same sample (dev-fit; the held-out
test is the next fresh sample), 19 labeled decisions, top-10 only. The durable
read: the JSON surface is sufficient for the protocol (no decision needed source
access), the recipe's failure modes are *calibration* failures fixable in the
document, and the residual is the same judgment frontier the scanner itself
deliberately leaves to the caller.

## BY. Declaration runs — the first decidability-boundary filter, priced on the corpus

A fresh-repo head-of-ranking audit (three sibling projects: a 1,351-file TS app,
two small Go CLIs) found an import-statement block ranked #5 on a default scan —
seven textually-identical `import … from` lines across two modules. The
detection is correct and the duplication real, but the language *mandates* those
declarations per file: no extraction exists, so no judgment is owed. That is a
class boundary, not a one-off: [design.md §2b](design.md) now names it — a
reported family claims both *similarity* (held to proof discipline) and
*actionability*, and actionability splits by **decidability**. Judgment-deep
non-action (parallel-by-design) stays with the consumer; mechanically-decidable
non-action is the detector's job, with the same fail-closed posture as the
equivalence channel.

The filter: a family whose **every member span** consists solely of
import/include/`use`/re-export declarations (plus blanks and full-line comments,
per-language line grammar, multi-line statements tracked to their close) is
reclassified `recommended_surface: "declaration"` — off the human/markdown/
SARIF/`--fail-on` surfaces, counted in the omitted line, kept in
`--format json --top 0` (classification, never deletion). Fail-open by
construction: an unsupported extension, an unreadable span, an unclosed
multi-line statement, or any line not provably a declaration keeps the family
on its ranked surface. The mixed-span shape (imports + one real statement) is
locked as a fixture.

**Corpus price** (105 pinned repos, artifacts in `eval/declaration_runs/`, 2026-06-11): 2,265 families across 43 repos leave the default surface — java 1,850
(import blocks above parallel command classes), python 254, ts 90, js 30,
rs 30, tsx 11. Joined against the v5 labels by span overlap: 419 overlaps,
**1** with a worthy label — nushell's polars-command module headers
(`6094823c2d64a432`, extract-base, medium confidence, "imports + struct decl
shared via base/macro"). Inspected: the declaration family is the
imports-only 8–14 sub-span; the label's actionable content (the whole
near-identical command module) still reports via two default-surface families
(the 3–15 near pair and the whole-file 1–186 family). Zero worthy families
were themselves reclassified.

Two residuals, deliberately left: (1) spans that *start inside* a multi-line
`use {`/`import (` statement fail open and stay default (conservative by
design); (2) small same-import modules can pair at module granularity ("8 of
58 lines shared" with the 8 being the import block) — the shared-lines
generalization ("classify when the *invariant* lines are all declarations")
was rejected because at text level it cannot be distinguished from a renamed
twin whose every line differs textually: that is not mechanically decidable,
so per §2b it stays with ranking (extractability already sinks these) and the
upstream fix — keeping import declarations out of module-unit fingerprints —
is a detector change to price separately.

## BZ. Adversarial co-evolution, series 1 — five campaigns, the runbook's first execution

First execution of the [adversarial-coevolution runbook](adversarial-coevolution.md)
(#268): five bounded campaigns rotating the attack surfaces, run end-to-end by an
agent in one session. The attacked commit is the #267 merge; defenses landed on the
`coevo/series-1` branch with the full gate battery.

**C1 — declaration filter, claim-violation direction.** White-box reading of the
§BY matchers found the recognizers matched a declaration *prefix*, not a
declaration *line*: `import pdb;pdb.post_mortem()`, `require 'x'; File.open(…)`,
and jekyll's multi-declarator `_ref = require('./protocol'), Parser = _ref.Parser…`
all classify — and all three shapes exist verbatim in the pinned corpus. Eight
violation packets (py/js/go/ruby/java/rust/c) locked as fail-open tests; the
generalized defense is the **single-statement discipline** (a lone terminal
semicolon for `;`-grammars, none for the rest, strict `NAME = require('lit')`
shape, `#include` delimiter check) — one rule family, not eight patches.
Corpus re-price after tightening: **identical** (2,265 declaration families,
43 repos, worthy overlaps unchanged) — the fix is free.

**C2 — grouping/hints.** Two violations of the "call the existing helper is safe
advice" claim: a helper living in test code recommended to production copies
(wrong direction), and a helper in a generated file (not the maintainer's API).
Both guarded (`is_test_loc` exported from nose-detect; `looks_generated` check)
and locked with direction tests — the inverse (test copies → prod helper) stays
recommended. Union-find chaining (A∩B, B∩C ⟹ one group without A∩C) was attacked
and **accepted**: a chain of ≥50%-overlaps is one connected region.

**C3 — performance & determinism (new surface).** Pathological input: two ~4.8k-line
Python files, 240 import blocks + 7.2k tiny units. Measured: **3.1 s wall vs 0.63 s
for a 1,364-file real repo** — `NOSE_TIME` attributes 2.46 s to `normalize+extract`
at ~1 core (per-file parallelism serializes on few-huge-files inputs; the §BH class
in structural form — filed #269, defense deferred to core work). The CLI-layer
share (~0.1 s) was the declaration classifier's per-member full-file reads —
defended by routing the classification pass through one `FileLineCache` (246 reads
→ 2 on the fixture). Determinism: byte-identical JSON across repeated runs and
`RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1/4/default`. A failed fixture iteration was itself a finding:
uniform-shaped filler lines (`CONST_A_i = n`) token-match across files as Type-2
runs and bridge import blocks — synthetic-input design must vary token *shape*,
not just names.

**C4 — exact gates / oracle, price-only.** Six probes: `+=` vs `= +`, ternary vs
if/else, `not(a==b)` vs `!=`, guard-return vs nested-if, index- vs
element-iteration all **converge** (the last is stronger than documented). The
clamp-law probe escalated five levels and was **refuted by a sound gate at every
level**: untyped forms differ under NaN (type gate); unproven bounds differ when
`lo > hi` (bound-order gate); and the realistic `raise ValueError()` guard leaves
value fingerprints *equal* (the law fires — verified) but the opaque constructor
call disqualifies the unit from strict-exact eligibility (sound: shadowed
`ValueError` = different behavior). Only the test-fixture shape `raise 0` passes
all three gates and emits `value-graph.clamp.integer-ordered-minmax` provenance.
This **explains the LawPack field audit's zero-provenance mystery** (10,967
families, 0 laws): provenance requires (int evidence) ∧ (bound proof) ∧
(strict-exact-safe unit), and the third conjunct has ~zero field probability.
Filed #270 with directions (pairwise-identical-opaque-effect admission,
call-target evidence for builtin constructors, or re-pricing LawPack investment).

**C5 — limit-claim freshness + boundary re-attack.** clone-types spot-checked
fresh (index-iteration convergence is within the documented index-assignment
modeling). Re-attacking the C1 defense found one more hit: Ruby modifier
conditionals (`require 'x' if expensive_check()`) ride an expression on the
declaration — tightened and locked. The C2 guard's intended direction locked by
test.

**Series learnings folded into the runbook**: the claim-violation asymmetry
(pricing gates *recall* attacks; violations of a "provably…" claim are
soundness-class and fixed at any prevalence — all of C1/C2/C5's hits were these);
defense-deferral as a first-class verdict (C3 core finding → #269, C4 structural
finding → #270); a performance/determinism attack surface with the §BH-class
serialization shape; series-level tracking (one issue, five campaigns); and
measured campaign costs. Series wall-clock: ~70 minutes of agent time for five
campaigns (C1 ~12, C2 ~8, C3 ~15, C4 ~20, C5 ~6, recording ~10), plus ~3 min per
corpus re-price sweep and 23 s per full e2e suite run — cheap enough to run per
release.

## CA. Adversarial co-evolution, series 2 — fresh subagent attackers (blind/informed/personas)

Second runbook execution (#272), first under the series-2 **attacker modes**: five
fresh-context subagents — no authoring history, blind ones denied the test suite —
with persona rotation (grammar lawyer, adversarial reviewer, coverage auditor,
CI-gate skeptic, docs-vs-code auditor). The author stayed assessor/defender only.
The mode change paid for itself in round one.

**S2-C1 (blind, grammar lawyer → declaration matchers).** The fresh attacker found
the class the author's two passes missed: **open multi-line declarations consumed
interior lines unvalidated**, and closers were suffix checks (`os.Exit(1))` "closes"
a Go import block; `} || x();` "closes" a JS import; `require 'fs' + 1` rides
arithmetic on a Ruby require; `#include <stdio.h> int x = 1;` rides a definition on
a directive). The author's series-1 assumption — "in code that parsed, only
specifiers can occur inside an open declaration" — is void because tree-sitter is
error-tolerant: parse success does not certify interior content. Defense, third
wave of the same generalization: **interior lines must validate as specifiers
per-language, closers must match strict shapes exactly, and trailing arguments
(C includes, Ruby requires) must be lone string literals**. Five new violation
packets locked as fail-open tests. Two fail-open leaks (Python docstrings,
multi-line block comments inside spans) priced LOW — they require *identical*
comments in both members — and recorded, not defended.

**S2-C2 (blind, adversarial reviewer → grouping/hints).** One priced hit: the
"call the existing helper" early return **bypassed the high-parameter caution** —
a copy diverging from the helper at 8 spots got unqualified advice. Fixed; caution
now rides the helper hint. Refuted/recorded: identical-span double families and
repeated in-family locations (upstream invariants), transitive chaining (accepted
in §BZ), helper visibility (judgment-axis → consumer), witness-kind future-proofing
(closed set, verified by S2-C5).

**S2-C3 (informed, coverage auditor → the declaration battery).** 15 gaps ranked;
7 adopted as fixture rows the code supported but no test locked: `pub(crate) use`,
single-line aliased Go import, single-line `from X import Y`, `require('json')`,
`#include<no-space>`, `import{` no-space, and the ASI multi-line import closing
without a semicolon. The informed attacker also confirmed the `no`-table's
asymmetries were intentional. (Multilingual e2e flagged as the one structural gap;
deferred — unit rows cover matcher logic, one e2e covers the pipeline.)

**S2-C4 (blind, CI-gate skeptic → review --fail).** Ten packets, **zero
violations**: every aggressive configuration traced to a sound fail-closed branch
(capped varying-spot lists refuse to prove; first-sibling selection can only
under-fire; insertion boundary arithmetic correct at the edges). Two
conservative-direction notes recorded (sibling-selection incompleteness, spot-cap
misses) — both consistent with "fires on proof, never on absence of one".

**S2-C5 (blind, docs-vs-code → scan JSON contract).** Contract verified exhaustively
in both directions: zero undocumented emissions, zero documented-but-missing fields,
invariants hold (counts sum, `overlap_primary_id` slices-only, witness kinds exact).
One stale artifact: the checked-in v1 example fixture lacked `declaration: 0` and
the contract checker didn't require it — fixture refreshed, checker now asserts
`generated` and `declaration` keys.

**Corpus price** — and the assessor catching the defender: the first re-price
after tightening came back 2,261 (py 254 → 250). The bare-`)` strict closer had
broken a real Python idiom — parenthesized imports whose final names share the
closing line (`    Mapping)`) — a fail-open regression the synthetic battery
missed and the corpus instrument caught. Closer refined to "module-list + `)`"
and locked as a fixture row; final price: **2,265 declaration families, 43
repos, 1 worthy span-overlap, zero reclassification** — identical to series 1.
Three waves of hardening, zero recall cost, and one demonstration that the
label-join re-price is a regression gate, not a formality. **Mode verdict**: blind subagents found
a class two authored passes missed (the isolation works); the informed auditor
produced complementary coverage, not duplicates (keep the modes separate); the
docs-vs-code persona returned green at near-zero cost (cheap to keep in rotation).
Series wall-clock ~50 min: 5 parallel attackers ~8 min, assessment+defense ~30 min,
recording ~10 min.

## CB. Adversarial co-evolution, series 3 — executable packets, the ledger, and slot rules pay out

Third runbook execution (#274), first under the series-3 method upgrades: the
executable-packet contract (attackers run their own reproducers and submit
expected-vs-observed), the `bench/coevo/packets.v1.json` ledger with
no-resubmission lists, and slot rules (claim-direction only; freshness rotation —
series-2 green surfaces rotated out, never-attacked surfaces rotated in).

**S3-C1 (blind grammar-lawyer → the series-2 NEW matcher code).** Six
self-verified violations, every one carrying a reproducing family id: the
from-clause of single-line `import`/`export … from` accepted ANY source
(`import { x } from Math.max("a", "b");` classified as a declaration run), the
Python simple form accepted any names (`from x import max("a", "b")`), and Java
accepted any path text (`import java.util.x + y;`). Fourth wave of the
single-statement discipline: from-sources must be lone string literals,
specifier sections must hold specifier tokens, Python name lists and Java dotted
paths must validate. The wave count itself is now evidence for the deferred
generalization-level escalation (AST facts over text grammar — see the series-2
evaluation; not picked up this series).

**S3-C2 (blind cache-skeptic → `--cache-dir` equivalence).** The attacker found
a real code-path asymmetry — the cached path skips the corpus-level
`resolve_imported_immutable_bindings` pass the cold path runs — but eight
executable probes (six attacker, two assessor) could not expose an output
divergence. Deferred as #275 with the construction notes: the claim is
unfalsified but rests on an unproven invariant. The executable contract worked
exactly as intended here — a code-smell report without a reproducer stayed a
lead, not a "violation".

**S3-C3 (blind boundary-skeptic → `is_test_loc` / `--scope`).** Two reproduced
counterexamples to the doc's "production is NEVER misclassified" claim: a prod
validator named `test_data_loader.py` and an OpenAPI `spec/` directory tag as
test. Assessor verdict: the markers are ecosystem conventions and stay (removing
`spec/` breaks RSpec; pytest WOULD collect `test_*.py`); the violated artifact
was the **claim wording** — softened to "conventions win; scope is display
context". `--scope` itself verified green across formats and exit codes.

**S3-C4 (blind baseline/ignore attacker, re-spawned write-capable).** The
series' gem: `paths: ["vendor/**"]` suppressed a family whose OTHER copy lives
in `src/` — first-party duplication silently passed `--fail-on any`, and
any-member matching was even documented. Defense: **all-members selector
semantics** (an entry describes families wholly inside its selectors) for both
`paths` and `languages`, doc updated, gate-firing test locked. Five further
packets (span drift above a clone, renames, `--mode` switches re-keying
baselined families; `family_id` ignores drifting with the same key) assessed
as deliberate key-shape behavior in the LOUD direction — defended with honest
doc fences (pin `--mode` with baselines; re-baseline after refactors) rather
than key surgery. Expiry, third-copy detection, unchanged-rerun suppression:
green.

**S3-C5 (informed coverage auditor → series-2 helpers).** Twelve gaps, seven
adopted as fixture rows (Go `.`/`_` aliases, Rust nested-brace interiors, JsTs
`$`-identifiers, multi-line `export … from` closers, `require('lib')`,
`from x import *`, `Dict as D`) plus the `params == 6/5` caution boundary and
two strict-closer rejection rows.

**Method results.** The executable contract cut assessment to verification of
expected-vs-observed plus judgment (the attacker-reported family ids reproduced
on first check); one Explore-type attacker refused the contract (read-only
self-interpretation) and was re-spawned write-capable — the runbook now names
the capability requirement. The ledger absorbed series 1–2 as condensed
backfill plus nine series-3 entries (24 total). Slot rules held: zero recall
slots spent, both refreshed surfaces and three never-attacked surfaces yielded.
Corpus price after the fourth tightening wave: re-priced below. Series
wall-clock ~75 min: 5 attackers ~10 min parallel (one re-spawn), assessment +
defense ~45 min, recording ~20 min.

**Corpus price, series 3.** The assessor instrument fired twice on the
defender: the first re-price after the name-list validation came back 2,247
(py 254 → 236) — `import os  # noqa` and single-line `from x import (a, b)`
are real wiring the validator rejected. Inert trailing comments are now
stripped and single-line parenthesized lists accepted, both locked as fixture
rows. Final price: **2,265 declaration families, 43 repos, 1 worthy
span-overlap, zero reclassification** — identical through four hardening
waves. The label-join re-price has now caught a fail-open regression in two
consecutive series; it is a regression gate in fact, not just in name.

## CC. The AST-facts migration + the deferred-queue dispositions

The series-3 evaluation set three preconditions for series 4; this section
records all three.

**Wave counting cashes out: declaration classification moves onto AST facts.**
Four hardening waves of the text line-grammar (§BY → §BZ → §CA → §CB) kept
leaking payload-validation holes because line text approximates what the parser
already knows. `nose_frontend::declaration_facts(ext, src)` now exposes
per-line facts from the tree-sitter AST — declaration statements (per-language
node kinds incl. validated CJS `require` and Ruby `require` calls), comment
lines, and a **code-poison pass** (any named leaf outside declarations/comments
poisons its lines, which kills `import os; evil()` shapes structurally). ERROR
subtrees are never marked declarations, so tree-sitter's error tolerance — the
root cause behind §CA's interior-smuggling packets — now works FOR the
classifier instead of against it. The CLI's four-wave matcher stack (474 lines:
seven per-language line grammars, interior/closer validation, string-argument
helpers) is deleted; net −351 lines. **The 47-row adversarial battery carried
over unchanged** and caught two migration bugs before any corpus run (EOF
newline = MISSING token; node-end at column 0 over-covering the next line).

**The accept-distribution pre-gate, first scheduled run.** The corpus re-price
under the AST engine: **2,279 declaration families (+14 vs the text engine's
2,265: py +12, java +1, rs +1), 43+ repos, worthy overlaps unchanged, zero
worthy reclassification.** Sampled spans confirm the +14 are genuine
recoveries of recorded-low fail-open leaks the line grammar could not express
(multi-line imports with trailing comments and star-imports, mid-file `use`
blocks). Verdict: pass — recall-direction diff, zero cost.

**Deferred-queue dispositions.**
- **#269 (few-huge-files serialization): closed, no-prevalence.** Synthetic-only;
  real corpus worst cases run seconds at healthy parallelism; revisit condition
  recorded (a real repo > 10 s in `normalize+extract` at < 200% CPU).
- **#270 (law-provenance gating): closed, re-priced.** The three gates are each
  sound (refuted five-for-five in §BZ); the product conclusion is a Phase-3
  **entry gate** in the semantic-kernel roadmap: pack expansion now requires a
  priced consumer case, not axis breadth.
- **#275 (cache equivalence): ESCALATED from lead to reproduced violation.**
  The discriminating input that eight black-box probes missed came from mining
  the equivalence-test suite for a guaranteed-convergence shape: imported
  literal binding (`from tables import LOOKUP`) vs inline literal. Cold
  `--mode semantic`: 1 family, witness exact-value-graph; with `--cache-dir`:
  0 families — the cached path skips `resolve_imported_immutable_bindings`.
  Silent-miss direction; sound fix needs cross-file cache invalidation (core
  work, reproducer attached to the issue). Method note: **the test suite is a
  discriminating-input arsenal** — informed attackers should mine it.

**§CC addendum — the migration's performance packet (surface 8).** The AST
engine shipped with a regression the §CC pre-gate did not measure (the
re-price checks classification, not time): A/B against the pre-AST binary
showed sympy 4.96 → 6.42 s (+29%) and a 1,364-file TS app 0.546 → 0.760 s —
the classifier serially re-parsed nearly every family-hosting file. Defense:
a **sound-direction prescreen** (the span's first content line must look like
wiring or a mid-statement continuation; false negatives only fail open) plus
**parallel parsing** of the unique candidate files. After: sympy 4.67 s,
craken-agents 0.550 s — at or under the pre-AST baseline with byte-identical
classification. Two lessons folded back: (1) the prescreen's first draft
silently dropped a mid-statement-start family — caught by the classification
diff, not by timing, so perf defenses take the SAME pre-gate; (2) the
performance surface needs its own baseline pair in the pre-gate (wall time on
a family-dense repo, A/B against the prior binary), now noted in the runbook.

## CD. Adversarial co-evolution, series 4 — the AST classifier's first attack, evidence honesty, encoding

Fourth runbook execution (#279), five fresh-subagent campaigns against the
newest code (the AST declaration classifier from §CC, the all-members ignore
fix) plus two never-attacked surfaces (the #223 difference-evidence contract;
encoding/embedded-container robustness). The AST migration that ended four
text-grammar waves took its own first attack — and leaked, but at the node
level, not the line level.

**S4-C1 (blind grammar-lawyer → the AST classifier).** Four reproduced
violations, one root cause: `walk` marks a node `declaration` and **returns
without recursing** the moment `is_declaration` matches the kind, so the two
*call-shaped* whitelist entries (JS `const … = require()`, Ruby `require`)
never inspect their non-wiring children. A destructuring default
(`const { a = steal() } = require('lit')`), a computed key
(`{ [exfil()]: x }`), and a Ruby block (`require('x') { launch }`) each smuggle
a live call onto the import's line. The code-poison pass never saw them because
the subtree was skipped. Defense: the JS binding `name` and the Ruby `block`
field must execute nothing (`subtree_executes`, a bounded kind-walk for
call/await/arrow/new/yield) — plain destructuring (`const { a, b } =
require()`) stays inert wiring. Locked as no-rows.

**S4-C2 (blind evidence-skeptic → the #223 difference contract).** Six packets;
two were displayed-dishonesty bugs. `shared_lines` was a ≥60% **majority vote
across up to 8 members** but shown against the representative pair, so a 6-line
body could read `5 of 6 lines shared, 2 spots differ` (5+2=7) and three
identical `buf.append(x)` lines deduped to `2 of 6`. Split into
`SharedLines { rank_lines, display, params }`: the display count is now the
representative pair's physical invariant-line count (partitions the pair's diff
with `params`, no dedup), while the majority-voted `rank_lines` still drives
`shared_weight` so the ranking keeps its outlier robustness. The other four
(params from one pair = a documented lower bound; the `languages == 1` gate
dropping a same-language extractable sub-pair in a mixed family; `removable` on
a zero-shared structural match) are recorded as documented lower-bound
behavior, not fixed.

**S4-C3 (blind robustness-attacker → encoding/determinism).** Determinism held
byte-identical across repeats and `RAYON_NUM_THREADS`; CRLF, multibyte
identifiers, no-trailing-newline, long lines all green. One violation: a UTF-8
**BOM** on any member of an import-only family flipped it from `declaration` to
`default` (the BOM makes tree-sitter emit a line-1 error leaf that poisons the
first declaration), in Python and Rust — while the IL-lowering path already
tolerated it. Defense: strip a leading BOM in both `declaration_facts` and the
prescreen.

**S4-C4 (blind container-attacker → embedded `<script>`).** Five reproduced
defects, all from text byte-scanning instead of parsing: `</script>` in a JS
string literal truncates the block (miss); a commented-out `<script>` is
analyzed live and the span swallows `</body></html>`; a Vue 3.3
`generic="T extends Record<…>"` attribute `>` breaks tag-end detection;
`end_line` over-claims onto the closing tag; an unclosed `<script>` is dropped.
Deferred as #280 — grammar-driven boundary detection is frontend core work.

**S4-C5 (informed coverage auditor).** 14 gaps; adopted Rust `extern crate`, Go
`package`, and Ruby `require_relative` rows. The AST code-poison check (gap 6)
and the languages all-members selector (gap 12) were already locked — the first
by the migration routing every no-row through the AST engine, the second by
sharing the `.all()` code path the partial-path test exercises.

**Corpus price** (the pre-gate): **2,279 declaration families, same
per-extension split as §CC, zero worthy reclassification** — the S4-C1
tightening (call-shaped false declarations removed) and the S4-C3 loosening
(BOM'd files now classify) net to no change on the pinned corpus, because
neither shape is common there; the value of both fixes is in the field
(destructured CommonJS requires; Windows-authored BOM files) and the unit
battery, not the corpus count.

## CE. Adversarial co-evolution, series 5 — the moat's first attack finds the cardinal sin

Fifth runbook execution (#282), the first against the soundness CORE
(canonicalizer, exact-channel gate, oracle). It paid out the highest-value
result the project can produce: **confirmed false merges** — the cardinal sin
(design §1). All are LATENT: `nose verify bench/repos` stays green because the
pinned corpus lacks these shapes, exactly the §AS scenario design.md cites as
the whole reason adversarial batteries exist. Reproducers checked in at
`bench/coevo/false_merges/`; tracked P0 #283.

**S5-C1 (blind soundness-skeptic → canonicalizer).** Two false-merge families,
both verify-confirmed (the offline oracle's `--max-violations 0` gate fires):
(a) **effectful operands of a commutative/AC op** — `print(a)+print(b)` ≡
`print(b)+print(a)` (and AC chains, `*`, `^`); (b) **optimistic-Number
rewrites** — `-(-a)`≡`a`, `a&a`≡`a`, `a|a`≡`a` because the value domain infers
`Number` for a bare param *from the operation applied to it*, so the
"type-PROVEN" gate passes untyped. Root-causing (a) corrected a wrong first fix:
the merge is NOT via operand reordering in the canonicalizer (disabling the
reorder swap leaves them merged) — the exact-channel **node-multiset
fingerprint is inherently blind to a commutative op's operand order**, and
effectful calls in value position never emit ordered effect sinks. The fix is
the value-graph effect model, not a reorder guard — a speculative reorder-guard
patch was written, shown not to fix it, and reverted.

**S5-C2 (blind gate-skeptic → exact gate).** `a+b`≡`b+a` and `(a+b)+c`≡
`a+(b+c)` for untyped params: `+` commutativity/associativity treats Unknown
operands as numeric optimistically; wrong for strings (`"x"+"y"`) and floats
(`1e100`-cancellation). The detector merges; the verify oracle is BLIND
(below), so these evade the hard gate.

**S5-C3 (blind oracle-skeptic → `nose verify`).** The safety net itself has
holes: the interpreter maps every `Op` to one Rust `i64` operation, so Python
`%` (floored) ≡ JS `%` (truncated), Python `/` (true) ≡ Ruby `/` (floored),
JS `(x|0)+1` ≡ `x+1` (no int32 narrowing) — it declares non-equivalent
cross-language units behavior-equal, masking the very class of merge it exists
to catch. Index-store mutation is dropped and faked as a generic effect instead
of bailing. This is why S5-C2 evades detection and must be fixed first.

**S5-C4 (blind convergence-skeptic → recall).** Four oracle-confirmed
behaviorally-equal misses: `abs(abs x)`≡`abs x` and `~(a&b)`≡`~a|~b` (both
fully sound to add, #284); `max(max(a,b),c)`≡`max(a,max(b,c))` (compositional —
MIN/MAX are commutative but not AC-flatten-eligible in `ops.rs`; the cleanest
e-graph-revisit trigger); `x+x`≡`x*2` (the documented §BA gap).

**S5-C5 (informed coverage auditor).** 15 gaps; the byte-pack (u16/u32) and
low-bit-toggle rules have NO Lean proof (positive tests only), and many
type-gated rules have positive tests but no hard-negative proving the gate
holds — the AC-chain hard-negative gap is highest-risk and overlaps the #283
cluster.

**Verdict.** Series 5 is the validation of the entire adversarial paradigm: the
moat read clean on 105 repos while five distinct latent false merges (and a
holed oracle) sat in the core — found only by white-box crafting (§AS, exactly).
No same-session code fix shipped: every fix is moat work requiring a Lean
obligation and dev/heldout corpus pricing (defense-deferral is a first-class
verdict, and a rushed soundness patch that misidentifies the mechanism — as the
first reorder-guard attempt did — is worse than an honest P0). The deliverables
are the confirmed-reproducer battery, P0 #283, recall #284, and this ledger.

**Remediation (post-series-5, each priced separately).** The deferred fixes then
shipped as deliberate moat work, every one recall-neutral on `bench/repos`:
- **A — effectful AC operands (#286).** `reorder_safe` holds any subtree carrying a
  call/HOF/lambda/opaque (an observable effect the interpreter orders) in place at
  every operand-sort site; `print(a)+print(b)` no longer merges with its swap.
- **B — optimistic-Number rewrites (#283-B).** The `algebra` pass stopped cancelling
  `-(-x)` unconditionally (it has no operand type — same reason `!!x` was already
  deferred), and `-(-a)→a` / `a&a→a` now gate on `proven_numeric` (genuine evidence,
  never the self-referential "param is Num because `-`/`&` was applied to it"
  inference). Untyped stays split; annotated still folds. C4's `abs`/De-Morgan
  recall and MIN/MAX AC-flatten shipped together as #284.
- **D (mod) — language-blind `%` (#290).** A distinct `Op::FloorMod` for Python/Ruby
  floored `%` (interpreted with floor semantics) vs C-family truncated `Op::Mod`;
  the oracle is no longer blind here. The `/`-division three-way split and JS int32
  narrowing parts of D, plus C (untyped `+` commutativity — still oracle-blind), stay
  open in #283.

The remaining three (C, D-int32, D-div) are scoped in
[oracle-value-model](oracle-value-model.md) — which re-frames them as *three
independent* fixes (an input-battery gap, a canon-width problem, and the one
genuine `Float`-value gap), each with a sound fail-closed floor, rather than one
shared value-model extension. That document is the go/no-go gate before any of
the three is implemented.

## CF. Generalized pure inlining + the reinvented-helper containment channel

**Question.** §BJ priced *whole-unit pair* recovery from interprocedural inlining at
0.3% and demoted it. Does the mechanism pay for itself when the question changes —
(a) as a fingerprint-level substrate (callers of behaviorally-equal helpers converge in
`near`; call-form and inline-form converge), and (b) as the substrate for a NEW finding
class, [reinvented helpers](reinvented-helpers.md) (containment: a unit reimplements an
existing helper inline), which §BJ never measured?

**What shipped.** The straight-line-only inline whitelist became a generalized
admission (loops, branches, builder appends, nested proven calls) with an
evaluation-time sink fence, in-loop-return poisoning, return capture with `Phi`
folding, and a cycle guard ([normalization](normalization.md)); the containment join
matches a pure single-return helper's whole-body hash against other units' sub-DAG
anchors, excluding callers (their fingerprints contain the helper BY inlining) and
idiom-sized helpers. The exact-channel admission of calls (strict gate widening) is
deliberately NOT shipped — callers stay `near`-grade until that precision is measured
separately (the oracle-value-model floor-first discipline).

**Calibration.** On sympy the raw containment join fired 108 times; 77 were one
weight-7 delegation idiom (`self._print(expr.args[0])`, 12 source tokens) matched into
printer methods. Value-graph weight cannot separate a compressed accumulator loop
(`Reduce`, ~4 nodes, semantically rich) from a re-typeable one-liner, so the helper
floor is SOURCE size (≥ 20 tokens; noise band ≤ 12, real helpers ≥ 25) plus ≥ 8 value
nodes. After: 2 findings on sympy, both hand-verified true.

**Measured (2026-06-12, 105-repo corpus).**
- **Soundness:** `nose verify --max-violations 0` clean on sympy (37,564 units, 14,075
  interpretable — the largest single-repo surface) and axios+asciidoctor; the full
  workspace battery (973 tests) green. Zero false merges with generalized inlining live.
- **Determinism:** byte-identical scan JSON across 2/13/default thread counts (redis).
- **Performance:** sympy normalize+extract +2.4% median (interleaved A/B, 4 pairs) —
  the cost of evaluating helper bodies at call sites.
- **Default-surface stability:** family counts moved 0–3 per repo (axios 218→218,
  redis 1135→1138, jsoup 382→382, delve 740→737, sympy 30→30 default surface).
- **The new channel:** 16 findings / 105 repos across 8 repos. Hand-labeled: 16/16
  value-exact; ~13/16 directly actionable (call the existing helper); 3 judgment-deep
  containers (test files, vendored miniaudio). One finding is a real upstream BUG:
  h2database's `getGarbageCollectionCount()` copy-pasted the time variant and still
  calls `getCollectionTime()` — it exactly contains the time helper's computation,
  which is precisely what the channel claims.
- **Dogfooding:** the duplication gate caught THIS change's own first draft duplicating
  the existing `branch_returns` walk (26 > budget 25); fixed by reuse, gate back to
  25/25. The convergence tests: call-form ≡ inline-form for loop accumulators (the §BJ
  flagship shape), builder loops ≡ comprehension callers, guard-clause helpers ≡
  ternaries, two-hop helper chains, and name-independent congruence between callers of
  body-identical helpers.

**Verdict.** The §BJ "0.3%, don't chase pair recall" call stands — and the same
mechanism, pointed at containment instead of pair recovery, yields a small,
high-precision, novel finding surface at +2.4% scan cost. Floor-first shipped; exact
admission and default-surface promotion follow the labelset discipline.

## CG. Adversarial co-evolution, series 6 — the #299 surfaces (generalized inline, content keying, containment, oracle)

One protocol pass ([adversarial-coevolution](adversarial-coevolution.md)) aimed by the
freshness slot rule at the code merged in #299 (commit `fa35de2`). Four blind-mode
attackers, persona-rotated, executable packets, on the four claims #299 introduced.
Tracking issue #300; ledger `bench/coevo/packets.v1.json` (cases `s6-*`).

**S1 — generalized inline soundness (soundness-skeptic).** One violation: Python
keyword arguments lower to their value in source order, dropping the name, so
`helper(b=p, a=q)` is byte-identical IL to `helper(a=p, b=q)` and the two callers
false-merge as "exact behavior match" (−2 vs 5 on p=1,q=2). **Pre-existing** (occurs on
the opaque-call path; inline not load-bearing) and cross-language; the sound fix needs
IL Call keyword identity (a representational change). **Deferred #301.** The fence,
fold, in-loop-return poison, and Cond-passthrough all held against direct attack.

**S2 — content-keyed callee identity (binding-lawyer).** Two violations, split on
fixability:
- **S2-A (decorators) — fixed.** Python decorators are dropped in lowering, so `@double`
  vs `@triple` callers false-merged (caller(1)=40 vs 60). Fix: a new
  `SourceFactKind::Binding(DecoratedDefinition)` recorded at lowering; `DirectFunction`
  evidence and content-keyed seeding both skip decorated definitions. Precise, no
  over-fire; corpus effect is 4 Python repos (poetry, click, sqlalchemy, sympy), net −2
  families — genuine decorator-driven false merges removed.
- **S2-B (out-of-scope reassignment) — deferred #302.** `global helper; helper = x`
  inside another function inlines the original body (callers 1000 vs 2000). The natural
  gate ("name reassigned anywhere?") **cannot be made precise**: the frontend drops
  `global`/`nonlocal`, so a non-top-level `name = x` is indistinguishable from a local
  shadow. The broad predicate **over-fired — 37 corpus repos of recall loss** (netty −26,
  raylib −11) for zero soundness gain there — so it was reverted per *the defender's
  ceiling is provability*. Needs frontend global-binding tracking (same class as S1).

**S3 — reinvented-helper containment (claims-auditor).** Four packets; two false
findings fixed in code, two over-strong claims fixed in docs:
- **S3-2 (caller via inlined-callee span) — fixed.** A pure caller of a function that
  inline-reinvents the helper was itself reported (the called-helper record is one call
  level deep). Fix: reject a finding whose matched anchor carries a REAL source span
  outside the container's own line range — that span belongs to the inlined callee.
- **S3-3 (bound-blind Reduce) — fixed.** An indexed `while i < n` absorbs the bound into
  a pointer-length contract, dropping it from `cond_sinks` AND the `Reduce` hash, so a
  fold over `i < n-1` value-exactly "contained" a fold over `i < n` (11 vs 22 on
  xs=[1,1]). Fix: `sink_profile` now reports `used_length_contract`; contract-bound
  helpers are ineligible (their return hash doesn't determine their value). Conservative
  — also drops the same-bound true positive (S3-1's shape), a sound recall loss, since
  the bound is unrecoverable from the hash. Genuine length iteration is unaffected.
- **S3-1 (approximate site) / S3-4 (type-erased fix) — docs honesty.** A loop-fold match
  has no precise span, so the site is the whole container (`site_approximate` flag
  added); and field access hashes by name, so a Go container can value-exactly contain a
  helper of a different struct type whose call would not compile. Both are TRUE findings
  with an over-strong *fix* claim — reframed as advisory (call the helper for the matched
  part; type-check the suggested call), not mechanical line replacement.

**S4 — oracle completeness (oracle-attacker). Green.** No violation. The inline
admission and the oracle's callee-execution gate resolve the same `DirectFunction`
target from the same evidence, so the oracle is at least as general as the inline.
Census: ~43% of the inline-created merge mass is oracle-opaque — all in the fail-closed
`uninterpretable` bucket (free module globals, floats, JS C-style for-loops), exclusion
mass, not silent SOUND.

**Boundary re-attack.** One round on the new gates. Decorated *methods* still merge
across `@double`/`@triple` — but a no-decorator control with different method bodies
merges identically, so the cause is the **pre-existing opaque method-name identity**
(`self.helper` keyed by name), not the S2 content path, and predates #299. Recorded as a
known boundary (clone-types: unproven methods are name-keyed). Conditional reassignment
and length-contract-vs-`for` boundaries held.

**Verdict.** Two ships (S2-A decorator fact, S3 containment gates), four defers/greens
(S1 #301, S2-B #302, S3-1/S3-4 docs, S4 green). Net corpus: **16 reinvented findings
preserved** (the S3 gates removed only synthetic adversarial cases, zero real-finding
recall), **−2 false merges** removed from 4 Python repos by the decorator fact, recall
otherwise neutral, soundness and determinism re-verified. The campaign's sharpest lesson
is S2-B: a false merge whose only available defense is an unprovable guess is a
*deferred* finding, not a shipped guess — the 37-repo over-fire is exactly the §BA "17
false merges" failure mode in the recall direction.

## CH. Adversarial co-evolution, series 7 — the binding-provenance machinery (#304 kwargs, #305 global-rebind)

One protocol pass ([adversarial-coevolution](adversarial-coevolution.md)) aimed by the
freshness slot rule at the code merged the same session in #304 (keyword-argument
by-name binding) and #305 (global-rebind detection) — commit `6a20b84`. Four blind-mode,
persona-rotated attackers; ledger cases `s7-*` in `bench/coevo/packets.v1.json`. Tracking
issue #306. **The session's own fresh code, attacked immediately — three of the four
attackers found real false merges in it.** This is the §AS lesson applied to one's own
work: do not assume a just-shipped fix is correct; craft against it.

**S1 — splat erasure (Python arg specialist). Two violations, fixed.** The frontend
stripped `*expr`/`**expr` to the bare expression, so `f(*args)` lowered identically to
`f(args)` and `f(**d)` to `f(d)`. `stats(*xs)` false-merged with `stats(xs)` (len 3 vs 1
on `[[1,2,3]]`), and `nose verify` read SOUND because both the value graph and the oracle
used the stripped IL — the §AS "green corpus, latent false merge" scenario. Fix: a new
`NodeKind::Splat` (declared last, so discriminants/shape-hashes are unchanged) carries the
`*`/`**` marker; the call stays fingerprint-distinct, the inline binding plan fails closed
on a spread (dynamic arity), and the oracle evaluates a spread to its inner value only for
opaque calls (where the fingerprint already separates the forms).

**S2 — rebind forms (Python scoping lawyer). Four soundness misses, three fixed + one
deferred.** #305 recorded the `ModuleRebind` fact in one place — a single-identifier
`global helper; helper = x`. Tuple-unpack (`helper, x = ...`), aug-assign (`helper += 1`),
and walrus (`(helper := ...)`) all lower to an `Assign` via different paths and escaped.
Fix: a post-lowering pass over each function records `ModuleRebind` on every `Assign`
whose target (a `Var`, or a `Seq` of them) names a `global`-declared symbol — uniform
across forms. `globals()['helper'] = ...` (a dynamic write with no `global` statement)
is a distinct mechanism, deferred as #307. The attacker's two recall probes self-refuted:
the gate stays precise (a local `helper = 5` carries no fact), so — unlike series-6's
reassigned-anywhere predicate — there is no over-fire (measured: small mixed family
deltas, the signature of false merges *separating*, not recall loss).

**S3 — effectful keyword reorder (interaction hunter). Two violations, fixed.** The #304
keyword name-sort converged `combine(a=sideA(x), b=sideB(y))` with the reordered
`combine(b=sideB(y), a=sideA(x))`. But Python evaluates arguments in SOURCE order, so when
the keyword values are effectful (a call that raises or has side effects) the two orders
observably differ. This is the §CE/#286 lesson again — reordering operands is sound only
when they are effect-free. Fix: gate the keyword name-sort on `reorder_safe`; pure
reorders still converge, effectful ones stay in source order.

**S4 — oracle parity (oracle attacker). Green.** No oracle blind spot: by-name binding is
shared through `keyword_arg_binding_plan`, source order is preserved, rebinds are opaque
to both layers, and unbindable kwargs fail closed (excluded). The oracle stayed
lockstep-or-stricter — it WITNESSED the S3 effectful reorder (advisory) and surfaced a
residual **string-literal `+` commute** (`"p"+"q"` ≡ `"q"+"p"`, a hard violation) caused
by a string `Const` key wrapping out of its domain range — a pre-existing canonicalizer
bug in a different subsystem, deferred as #308.

**Verdict.** Three ships (S1 splat, S2 rebind forms, S3 effectful reorder) and three
defers/greens (S2-4 globals #307, S4 green, S4-residual string-+ #308). Every shipped fix
is a false merge the just-merged #304/#305 introduced or left — the campaign's value is
exactly that it attacked fresh code instead of trusting it. Soundness re-verified
(`nose verify --max-violations 0` clean on sympy, 13,928 interpretable after the oracle
recovered splat coverage), determinism byte-identical, dup gate 25/25, recall precise (no
over-fire). The recurring theme across series 6–7 holds: every soundness miss was the
frontend discarding a binding-discriminating token (keyword names, `global` declarations,
splats), and every fix preserves it in the IL.

## CI. Adversarial co-evolution, series 8 — the value-model literal/numeric keying (post-#308)

One protocol pass ([adversarial-coevolution](adversarial-coevolution.md)) aimed by the
freshness slot rule at the literal-keying / value-domain classification just changed in
#308 — the string-`+`-commute fix that masked string `Const` keys. Two blind attackers
(numeric-domain skeptic, value-model skeptic); ledger `s8-*`; tracking issue #311.
**The #308 fix's own author claim — "ints/floats are fail-closed when their key wraps" —
was attacked and refuted**: the same self-attack discipline as series 7, one merge later.

**Three confirmed false merges, all in the packed-key encoding (S1+S2, fixed).** The
value-graph `Const(u32)` tagged the literal kind in the top nibble and packed the
value/hash into the low 28 bits — fundamentally too few bits, so:
- an **int wrapped its kind nibble**: `536870914` (`0x2000_0002`) keyed to `0x3000_0002`,
  byte-identical to `LitBool(true)`, so `x + 536870914` ≡ `x + True`;
- an **int truncated to 32 bits**: `v as u32` collapsed `0 ≡ 2^32` and `5 ≡ 4294967301`
  (2^32 is a plausible real constant);
- a **string collided in 28 bits**: #308's mask `0x2000_0000 | (h & 0x0FFF_FFFF)` kept
  only 28 of the 64 hash bits, so brute-forced `"geU"`/`"aaha"` collapsed to one key —
  #308 had *traded* the out-of-range bug for a collision bug.

**Fix (#313): carry the kind, not infer it from a range.** `ValOp::Const(u32)` became
`ValOp::Const { kind: ConstKind, bits: u64 }` — the kind is explicit and `bits` holds the
FULL i64 value (Int), the full 64-bit content hash (Str/Float), the boolean, or a sentinel
discriminant. With the kind separated there is no range for a value to escape and no
truncation; all three false merges are closed by construction, the #308 mask is removed,
and the string-`+`-commute fix it was protecting still holds (the kind is read directly).
Corpus: small POSITIVE family deltas (sympy +6, redis +4) — the false-merge-separating
direction — soundness clean on sympy + guava (49k interpretable units), determinism
byte-identical.

**S2 green — the algebraic canon held.** Distribution `a·c+b·c≡(a+b)·c` on strings (gated
tight via the no-`Mul`-numeric-inference rule), `a + "literal"` commutativity (held
ordered), loose-vs-strict equality (unwitnessable — the oracle has no coercion model), and
De Morgan / abs idempotence (sound for all integers) all survived. The exploitable surface
was purely the literal-key hashing, not the canonicalizations — and floats are
structurally un-attackable for now (the interpreter has no `LitFloat` arm, so a float
behavioral difference can't be witnessed; a latent gap recorded, not a confirmed merge).

**Verdict.** A core value-model fix closing three false merges — one of them introduced by
#308 the same session. The series 6–8 theme completes its shape: every soundness miss was
a kind/identity token lost in an encoding (keyword names, `global`, splats, then literal
kinds), and every fix preserves it explicitly rather than inferring it from a lossy pack.

## CJ. Scan performance — profiler-first extraction hotspots (2026-06-13)

Performance pass against `origin/main` (`6f61fb3`) using `NOSE_TIME=1`,
`NOSE_TIME_NORMALIZE=1`, `NOSE_TIME_UNIT_SUMMARY=1`, and macOS `sample` on the pinned
local bench repos. The profiling target was the semantic scan `normalize+extract` path,
not candidate scoring: on sympy, the instrumented baseline spent `2726.2ms` in
`normalize+extract` after lowering, with cumulative unit timing dominated by value graph
builds for units that were later skipped (`Block value=4837.6ms`, `Function
value=2270.3ms`). The hottest skipped block file was
`sympy/physics/quantum/tests/test_spin.py` (`1326` block candidates, `1325` skipped,
`739.8ms` value time).

Five profiler-backed hotspots were removed without changing scan output:

1. Context-backed value graph builders now borrow the file-level `local_scope_nodes`
   bitmap directly. The old `Builder::new(...).with_context(...)` path built a fresh
   bitmap before replacing it with the shared one.
2. Exact fragments that fail the exact-safety gate return before value fingerprinting.
   The later dense gate already required `exact_safe && value.len() >= EXACT_VALUE_MIN`,
   so this only removes dead work.
3. Exact-fragment recognition is called only for node kinds any migrated recognizer can
   accept (`Return`, `Throw`, `Assign`, `ExprStmt`, `If`, `Loop`, `Block`).
4. Block-unit collection and exact-fragment candidate collection share one DFS while
   preserving the old output order: block roots first, exact-only roots appended, and
   lambda bodies still excluded from exact-fragment collection.
5. Module-seed required bindings memoize module-scoped symbols per subtree. Repeated
   overlapping `collect_all_node_symbols_in_scope` walks across many per-file roots now
   reuse the cached subtree symbol sets.

The local fast gate exposed one adjacent verify-only hotspot while validating the
change: `verify` asked `units_of_file` for the exact claim surface before applying the
node-row battery budget, so a 4,908-token C function that was ultimately reported as
`battery-bail` still spent `71.55s` in release value-graph canonicalization. Verify now
computes exact-safety only for functions under the battery budget and combines that with
the fingerprint it already builds (`exact_claim_eligible_parts`), avoiding duplicate unit
extraction for excluded functions.

Measured output was byte-identical (`cmp`) for sympy, rubocop, and prettier semantic
scans. The instrumented sympy run dropped `normalize+extract` from `2726.2ms` to
`2082.2ms` (about `-23.6%`). A lower-overhead warm reverse-order sympy pair dropped
`normalize+extract` from `3176.9ms` to `2211.3ms` (about `-30.4%`). Smaller repo checks
kept the same direction after repeat/reverse runs: rubocop repeated pairs moved from
`234.1/271.5ms` to `157.2/185.1ms`, and prettier moved from `343.4ms` to `83.2ms`.

Regression coverage: `cargo test -p nose-detect`, `cargo test -p nose-normalize`, and
`cargo test -p nose-cli --test cli exact_fragments`. Two unit tests pin the collector
semantics most likely to regress: lambda-local returns stay excluded, and Java
`SelfFieldBody` fragments rooted at `Block` still collect. The verify battery-bail
regression test now completes in `0.93s` in the debug CLI test harness; the release
reproducer above drops from `71.55s` to `0.56s`; and `./scripts/check-ci-local.sh
--fast` passes.

## CK. Adversarial co-evolution, series 9 — the post-#283 operator gaps (shifts, Ruby `*`)

One protocol pass ([adversarial-coevolution](adversarial-coevolution.md)), aimed by the
freshness slot rule at code changed since series 8: the #283-C/D operator narrowings
(value-model/canonicalizer), the `nose verify` oracle (#317's type-incoherence finding),
and the #328 enrich-only-emitted perf path. Three blind fresh-subagent attackers, persona-
rotated (soundness-skeptic, oracle-bail-skeptic, perf-determinism); ledger `s9-*`; tracking
issue #329; commit `6f61fb3`.

**Two confirmed false merges, both in operators the #283 narrowings did not reach.**
- **JS bitwise *shifts* were not int32.** #283-D narrowed `& | ^` and `~` for JS via
  `js_int32_narrow` so they no longer merge with arbitrary-precision Python/Ruby bitwise,
  but `<<`/`>>` built a bare `Bin(Shl/Shr, [a,b])` identical to Python's — an exact
  cross-language merge though `1 << 31` is `-2147483648` in JS and `2147483648` in Python
  (and `(2**32) >> 0` is `0` vs `2**32`; both verified with `node`/`python3`). The in-code
  comment even *claimed* shifts were "narrowed at their own build sites" — they were not.
  Fix: `eval_binop_expr` narrows the shifted operand via `js_int32_narrow` for JS `Shl`/
  `Shr` (a no-op elsewhere; `>>>` was already kept distinct). JS-vs-JS shifts still converge.
- **Ruby `*` commuted, but it is repetition.** The reorder sites all assumed "`* & | ^` Err
  on non-numeric regardless of order, so stay safe" — false for Ruby, where `*` is string/
  array repetition and *asymmetric*: `"ab" * 3` → `"ababab"` but `3 * "ab"` raises
  (`Integer#*` rejects a String), and `[1,2] * 3` ≠ `3 * [1,2]`. Four sites reordered it:
  the `algebra` IL pass (constant-fold-to-end **and** hash-sort) and the value graph
  (AC-chain sort + the 2-operand commutative swap). Fix: one `ac_chain_commutes` predicate
  threaded through all four — `+` stays gated on non-concat (#283-C), and `*` commutes only
  when `lang != Ruby || all operands proven-non-concat`. **Largest sound generalization:**
  only Ruby is held, because Python repetition *is* commutative (`3 * "ab"` == `"ab" * 3`)
  and JS/TS/Java/Go/C `*` is numeric — so those five languages keep full `*` commutativity
  and lose no recall.

**Soundness by construction + measured.** Both fixes only ADD distinctions (a `ToInt32`
node; held operand order) — they can only SPLIT fingerprints, never create a merge, so no
new false merge is possible. Measured anyway: `nose verify --max-violations 0` clean on 13
repos across the changed-path languages (Ruby/TS/Python/Java/Go); scan output **byte-
identical** to `origin/main` on faraday, rack, axios, requests, gson (the merges were
latent — absent from the corpus, the §AS reason batteries exist); determinism byte-
identical across `RAYON_NUM_THREADS`. Permanent battery: two `equivalence.rs` tests with
the cross-language hard negatives and the Python/JS commutativity guards;
`bench/coevo/false_merges/ruby_star_repetition.rb`.

**Oracle surface — green-with-teeth + a sharpened boundary.** The oracle attacker re-
confirmed the #317/§7 type-incoherence false-positive class with a 2-line reproducer and
**sharpened its root**: the trigger is the EQUALITY (`==`/`!=`) canon meeting an `Err`
operand (relational `<` over the same incoherent subscript is clean, a bare subscript is
clean), and it is **language-independent** — untyped Python `b[s] == 0` reproduces it — so
the cause is `collect_file_verify_recs`'s concrete-only canon check not filtering `Err`,
not the absence of declared-param domain evidence per se. Recorded as `recorded-low-
prevalence`; the fix stays deferred (the cheap "skip `Err` rows" candidate must first be
vetted against the cross-unit false-merge check, where `Err`-vs-value IS a distinguishing
behavior). The bail taxonomy (`battery-bail`/`path-bail`/`uninterpretable`/`empty-
fingerprint`/`core-missing`) is printed and censused — no silent coverage drop (green).

**Perf surface — green-with-teeth.** The #328 enrich-only-emitted narrowing held under
attack: 2560 per-family witness comparisons on jedis across `--top {0,5,30}` and a 6-entry
ignore set spanning near ranks 2..2507 found zero witness loss, and 9/9 byte-identical
determinism checks across thread counts (the merge-time verification reproduced
adversarially).

**Verdict.** Two false merges closed at the operator layer the series-6–8 encoding fixes
never touched — the miss this time was not a lost identity token but an over-broad
*algebraic law* (commute/int32-equivalence) applied past the language where it holds. The
defense is the §BA pattern again: gate the law to exactly the languages/domains that prove
it, no further. Issue #329.

| packet | surface | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| s9-vm-shl-int32 | value-model | violation-fixed (JS `<<` int32-narrowed) |
| s9-vm-shr-int32 | value-model | violation-fixed (JS `>>` int32-narrowed) |
| s9-vm-ruby-mul-strrep | value-model | violation-fixed (`ac_chain_commutes` Ruby-`*` gate) |

## CO. Default-surface noise — the #263/#264 triage feedback, re-judged by fresh-repo audit

The triage-noise feedback ([#263](https://github.com/corca-ai/nose/issues/263) TS/React,
[#264](https://github.com/corca-ai/nose/issues/264) Go-CLI, [#11](https://github.com/corca-ai/nose/issues/11)
reason codes) was re-judged against the current binary on two public unseen repos
(goreleaser, excalidraw) — the §2c fresh-repo head-of-ranking instrument. Full record: [default-surface-noise-audit-2026-06-14](default-surface-noise-audit-2026-06-14.md).

**Both complaints reproduce**: the bare-default head is 60–76% test scope and 74–83%
`copy-paste-run`; the proven moat is 4–5% of the default surface. A 206-family
read-the-source labeling pass (KEEP 71 / DEMOTE 135) found the noise is **two
populations**: (a) *decidable-by-shape* (shallow `ratio = params/shared ≥ 0.33`, idiomatic
same-file, trivial, declaration, JSX) — separable scope-blind at **0.89 precision**, and
(b) the *AAA test-scaffold bulk* — **not separable from worthy test fixtures/helpers by any
feature** (the `test × copy-paste-run` cell's KEEP/DEMOTE medians are identical; every cut
caps at 0.76), so it is judgment-deep (§2 consumer-LLM call).

The `scope = test` lever is **measured-bad** (prec 0.74, demotes 28 worthy KEEP) —
confirming the documented principle that `scope` is a context tag, never a worthiness
penalty. The lever, split at the §2b decidability boundary: **(a)** the decidable
`shallow-extraction` reason code (#11) demotes off the default head (kept in JSON,
reason-coded; −34–36%, shipped); **(b)** the AAA bulk is handled by scope-aware
*rendering* (collapse test beneath prod, nothing dropped), not a penalty. One capability
(reason codes + scope-aware rendering) answers #11/#263/#264; the judgment residue stays
with the consumer.

**#353 (JSX `markup` code) — NO-GO.** A decidable behavior-free-JSX surface (no
`subtree_executes` node in the JSX subtree) was measured on two React repos before
building: **1 / 314** qualifying families on excalidraw (a static SVG `<path>`), **0 / 23**
on react-bootstrap. Structural, not a tuning miss: clone families are whole-component
functions (spans carry `function`/`return`), and real JSX embeds `clsx`/handlers/`.map`
(all executing) — catching the field's actual JSX examples needs whitelisting
list-render/class idioms, which is judgment, not decidable (§2). JSX-presentational-ness
becomes one **evidence** input for the consumer (the #11 vocabulary), not a detector
surface — see the audit doc §5.

**Tier-2 sibling-family folding — NO-GO (measured 2026-06-14).** A natural follow-up to the
scope-aware *rendering* lever above: the bare default surface is still a long list (per-repo
default families, fresh `--top 0`: rxjs 636, prometheus 1455, redis 484, zod 397), so collapse
the *per-variant sibling-family wall* — the rxjs per-operator marble tests, the prometheus
per-service AWS-discovery inits, the serde owned/borrowed impls — into one folded
"opportunity" the way overlap slices already fold, lifting the genuine standalone wins into
view. Fully implemented and measured on a 7-repo corpus slice (rich, serde_json, zod, rxjs,
prometheus, redis, cobra), reading cluster members' real source to judge coherence. **NO-GO,
for two structural reasons:**

1. **nose's own family grouping already folds the real repetition.** The "wall of N redundant
   sibling families" was a miscount: `finalize-spec.ts` is one **31-member** family,
   serde `write_i8` one **10-member** family, `serialize_newtype_variant` 25 members. The
   *separate* default families that remain are below the clone-merge threshold *because they
   are genuinely structurally distinct* — there is little true cross-family redundancy left to
   fold.

2. **Cross-family folding cannot cluster coherently — intrinsic, not a tuning miss.** A
   metadata key `(scope, extraction_shape, dir, size-band)` "reduced" the surface 72–89% but
   **incoherently** — rich's single best finding (`replace_link_ids`, a real shared test
   helper) was grouped with unrelated tests; a 4-line `__rich_measure__` with an 86-line
   `__init__`. Replacing the key with a leaf-abstracted value-DAG shape (per-node Merkle hash
   over `(VgOp, arity, child-hashes)`, ignoring the literal/name `key`; multiset compared by
   Jaccard or overlap-coefficient) does not rescue it: exact-match folds ~nothing (true
   siblings differ by ≥1 node, else they'd already be one family); Jaccard is defeated by the
   siblings' size variance; overlap-coefficient and even **complete-link @ Jaccard 0.6 still
   group `map.rs new()`/`iter()` with `deserialize_tuple_struct`** — a small function's
   leaf-abstracted whole-unit shape is generic ("calls + return" ≈ "construct + return"), so
   semantically-unrelated small units are mutually similar. No metric × threshold × linkage ×
   min-node floor separated true siblings from generic-shape collisions. Cost: **+67% scan
   time** (2.96 s → 4.94 s on prometheus) to re-lower the whole default surface for shapes.

Shipping folding would **hide distinct genuine findings under a misleading "same shape" label**
(the over-folding hazard) *and* slow scans — strictly worse. The whole-unit structural signal
is not clean enough to separate per-variant siblings from coincidental shape collisions. The
independent, source-verified lever from the same audit stands unaffected: a decidable
**evidence** flag for language-forced parallel duplication (`owned-vs-borrowed` /
`covariant-type-only` / `high-param-ratio`, a rollup of the graded per-spot `class`,
evidence-not-verdict), plus retiring "proven ⇒ trust/lead" (serde's top `shared-sub-dag` is
`Value` vs `&Value`, value 179, **params 15** — forced duplication at the head of the proven
channel). See the audit doc §5.

## CL. Honest headline numbers — scan's `shared_lines` to the all-copies basis (#366, 2026-06-14)

`nose query` reports the all-copies anti-unification economics (`M/REP shared · ~N
removable`, reusing #360's `anti_unify_all`); `nose scan`'s headline counted the
**representative pair**, so for a family whose 3rd+ copies diverge the two surfaces
disagreed — serde's 25-copy `serialize_newtype_variant` read `11 shared → ~264
removable` on scan but `4 shared → ~96 removable` on query. The pairwise number
over-states: the helper that folds *all* copies can only hoist what is invariant across
*all* of them. #366 converges scan's `shared_lines` (and the derived `~removable`) onto
that all-copies count.

The catch, found by measurement, is that `shared_lines` is **not** display-only: it feeds
the `shallow-extraction` surface test (`params ≥ ⅓·shared_lines`), which feeds
`default_surface_weight`, which multiplies into `extractability`. So the change re-ranks.
Gold-set audit (`bench/labels/eval_by_language.py`, v5 labelset, P@10 + worthy-recall,
dev/held-out, native `extractability` order):

| variant | dev P@10 | held-out P@10 | worthy-recall |
|---|---|---|---|
| baseline (rep-pair `shared_lines` + `params`) | 60% [55-65] n=379 | 59% [54-65] n=322 | unchanged |
| **all-copies `shared_lines`, rep-pair `params`** (shipped) | **61% [56-65] n=381** | **59% [53-64] n=321** | **unchanged** |
| all-copies `shared_lines` **and** `params` | 61% [56-66] n=380 | **57% [51-63] n=307** (Java 60→51) | unchanged |

Held-out is the generalization gate. Moving **`shared_lines`** alone holds it flat
(dev +1, recall byte-identical) — shipped. Also moving **`params`** to all-copies looked
principled (it correctly demotes the low-foldability serde family — the standing #365
target) but **regressed held-out** (59→57, Java −9): the all-copies hole count over-fires
`shallow-extraction` on dev-shaped families that don't generalize. So `params` deliberately
stays representative-pair (also keeping it tied to `varying_spots` and the frozen scan-JSON
v1 contract). The lesson repeats §AV/§CO: the residual ranking loss is judgment-deep, not a
number-basis bug — #365 needs its own signal (signature/arity heterogeneity), not a more
honest parameter count. Scan and query now print one shared/removable headline per family;
the `params`/`spots-differ` count stays each surface's own (scan = representative pair,
query = all-copies helper arity).

## CM. Foldability ranking — the member-span heterogeneity demotion (#365, 2026-06-14)

The 4-round `nose query` judge (§ query-surface) flagged that `extractability`'s #1
"cleanest to extract" was often the *least* foldable family: serde_json's #1 was 25
heterogeneous `Serializer` trait methods sharing ~4 all-copies lines, while the clean
10-method numeric-writer family sat lower. The formula rewards `copies × spread`, and 25
copies of an almost-but-not-quite-shared shape out-scores 10 copies of a tight one. #366
(§CL) didn't fix it — the dud's all-copies `shared_lines` is still enough, with a
representative-pair `params` of 1, to clear the shallow gate and ride its copy count to #1.

The decidable signal that separates them, found by mining the v5 labelset: **member-span
heterogeneity**. The per-member source span is the one size signal available without
re-parsing, and it is a clean proxy for the issue's "signature/arity heterogeneity" —
copies that vary widely in length are not one shape, so no single helper folds them. On
the 9,461-family labelset, not-worthy families carry **~2.7× the span coefficient-of-
variation** of worthy ones (mean 0.137 vs 0.051); families with CV ≥ 0.3 are worthy only
**23%** of the time vs 52% overall; the `coincidental-shape` not-worthy reason averages
CV 0.271. So `extractability` gains a `× 1/(1+CV)` factor (same-language only, like
`tightness`).

Strength was swept on the gold set and the gentle setting won — the §AV/§CL judgment-deep
pattern again. `eval_by_language.py`, v5, native `extractability` order:

| variant | dev P@10 | held-out P@10 | worthy-recall |
|---|---|---|---|
| baseline (post-#366) | 61% [56-65] n=381 | 59% [53-64] n=321 | — |
| **`× 1/(1+CV)`** (α=1, shipped) | **61% [56-66] n=380** | **59% [54-64] n=321** | **byte-identical** |
| `× 1/(1+2·CV)` | 61% | 58% | byte-identical |
| `× exp(−4·CV)` | 62% dev | 57% held-out | byte-identical |

Recall is **invariant** by construction — the penalty only reorders, never drops a family
from the candidate set. Held-out stays flat at α=1 (Go +4, Rust dev +4, no language down
beyond CI) and regresses as the penalty hardens (high-CV *worthy* families start paying).
So α=1 is shipped: it demotes serde's dud from #1 to #2 (the clean numeric writer takes
#1) and the other repos' #1 — already low-CV — are untouched, at zero measured precision or
recall cost. The aggregate P@10 move is within CI: the demotion is a real, validated, safe
correction of the *visible* failure, not a headline-precision jump — the residual ranking
loss is judgment-deep (genuinely-ambiguous, parallel-by-design families), confirming §AV.

## CN. Canon preservation up to abort — the impossible-input artifact (#369, 2026-06-14)

The nightly `corpus verify` gate had been red for days on **4 canon-preservation
violations** — all in libsodium's `fe25519` field arithmetic (`fe25519_add`/`sub`/`neg`,
`int32_t[10]` / `int64_t[5]` limbs). The exact-claim soundness lane was unaffected
(`SOUND: no false merges`); this was the stricter pair-free core-vs-full-IL self-check.

Dumping the differing battery rows settled it: **all 279, across all 4 units, had
`ret == Err` on both the core and the full IL** — zero rows where the return differed or
either side succeeded. These functions take three array params; the global battery binds
list/int mixes (e.g. the #337 element-mutation row makes one param a list, the rest ints),
so `f[i]` indexes a non-list — an input that can never occur. The unit **traps either
way**; the canonicalizer merely reorders the element-writes recorded *before* the trap,
so `core = {Err, effects:[]}` vs `full = {Err, effects:[…partial…]}`. The #344 int oracle
made these limb units interpretable, which is why the check started running on them
(v0.8.0 shipped with the gate red). This is exactly the impossible-input class
oracle-value-model.md §7 anticipated ("does not filter `Err`"); it had been masked off-
corpus (netty 3, sympy 20) but libsodium is pinned.

Fix: judge canon preservation **up to abort** — `behavior_equiv` treats two runs that
both return `Err` as equivalent regardless of their pre-trap effects, since an erroring
execution has no observable result and reordering operations ahead of a guaranteed trap is
behavior-preserving. `Ok→Err`, `Err→Ok`, and differing successful results still trip, so a
real behavior-changing canon is still caught; scoped to the canon-preservation comparison,
the soundness/false-merge lane untouched. Full-corpus `nose verify --max-violations 0` then
reads **PRESERVED ✓** with the soundness lane byte-identical — the benchmark.md "zero
violations" claim is true again. Lesson: an oracle that models `Err` as an observable
value must still treat *aborted* executions as resultless, or impossible inputs (which a
global positional battery cannot avoid) manufacture phantom behavior differences.

## CP. Coverage-loss attribution — where recall is actually bounded (#389, 2026-06-15)

§BS measured the behavior-keyed recall frontier **NO-GO** and stated the boundary plainly:
*"worthy-recall is bounded by **unit extraction** and judgment, not by missing matching
machinery,"* with the instrument limited to the ~29% of units that interpret. That makes the
gating question not "what normalization is missing" but "what never gets modeled in the first
place." `bench/type4/coverage_attribution.py` answers it: `nose stats --format json` over the pinned
105-repo corpus, with the `Raw`-node loss (constructs that lower to an opaque node, invisible
to value-matching) ranked by (language, surface-kind) prevalence
(`coverage_attribution.2026-06-15.json`).

**IL-lowering loss by language** (worst first): javascript 2.83%, rust 2.62%, typescript
1.20%, c 0.89%, go 0.65%, ruby 0.33%, python 0.22%, java 0.22%. So the two front-runner
languages for nose's own positioning (rust, js/ts) carry the most unmodeled mass.

**The lowering worklist** (top Raw mass, the #390 targets), three clusters dominate:
- **Rust pattern-destructuring** — `tuple_struct_pattern` 21.6k + `field_pattern` 5.4k +
  `struct_pattern` 5.2k + `remaining_field_pattern` 4.2k + `shorthand_field_identifier` 4.1k
  ≈ **40k** Raw nodes. The single biggest, most coherent lever; pure Rust.
- **async `await`** — typescript 21.0k + rust 7.9k + javascript 6.8k ≈ **36k**. The biggest
  *cross-language* lever.
- **error/control flow** — rust `try`/`?` 18.3k; go `defer` 17.6k, `channel_receive` 4.3k,
  `select_case` 3.6k. Language-idiomatic control constructs.

**Separate axis — parse coverage, not lowering.** `ERROR` nodes (tree-sitter parse failures)
are large (c 25.3k, js 11.2k, ts 3.7k, java 3.5k, go 3.4k, rust 2.6k) and several C entries
are declaration forms (`declaration`, `field_declaration`, `preproc_def`, `pointer_declarator`,
`type_definition`) that may be inherently low-value to model. These belong to a grammar/parse
triage, not the value-lowering worklist — flagged so they don't inflate the lever estimate.

**Verdict.** The measured worklist confirms §BS from the other side: recall headroom is in
**coverage** (modeling more constructs), led by Rust destructuring and async/await, not in
more matching machinery. Method note: the value-graph `Opaque` loss (the collection/mutation
gap, #391) is a *separate* dimension this instrument does not yet attribute — `Opaque` carries
no construct provenance today, so attributing it needs light instrumentation (tracked on #391),
not this script. Re-run after each lowering change to watch the ratio fall.

## CQ. Lowering fidelity — Rust constructor patterns as variant tests (#390, 2026-06-15)

The §CP worklist's single biggest, most coherent lever was Rust pattern-destructuring (~40k
`Raw` nodes, led by `tuple_struct_pattern` at 21.6k). Root cause: `lower_match_pattern_condition`
lowered a constructor pattern *as an expression* to build `scrutinee == lower_expr(pattern)` —
and `lower_expr` on `Some(v)`/`Ok(_)`/`Point { x, y }` hits the `Raw` catch-all. Worse, `Raw` is
keyed by subtree hash, so `Some(x)` and `Some(y)` (differing only in binding name) produced
*different* conditions and split otherwise-identical copies.

#390 lowers a binding constructor pattern to its **constructor path** (the discriminant) instead
— `scrutinee == Some`, parallel to how the unit variant `None` already lowered. The inner
bindings bind in the arm body and are not part of the variant test, so the condition no longer
splits on the binding name's subtree hash. The recognized `Some(_)`-style single-wildcard
*presence* pattern is left untouched (a downstream idiom converges `if let Some(_)` with
`.is_some()`; the fix is scoped to *binding* patterns).

**Measured:**
- **Coverage:** corpus rust `Raw` ratio **2.623% → 1.347%** (74.7k → 37.6k `Raw` nodes);
  `tuple_struct_pattern` `Raw` 21.6k → 3.4k (the residue is the preserved wildcard-presence
  cases). The single largest §CP lever, ~halved.
- **Soundness:** `nose verify --max-violations 0` clean on nose's crates + alacritty + bat +
  ripgrep — **0 false merges**. The change makes the variant test *more* specific, not less.
- **Recall (gold set, `eval_by_language.py --rank extractability`):** Rust worthy-recall **+1**
  (dev 369→370/411; held-out flat 245/255); every non-Rust language's worthy/recall byte-
  identical (the change is Rust-only, confirmed). Base (value-order) P@10 identical across all
  languages including Rust (69%/69%); the extractability re-rank P@10 column fluctuates run-to-
  run for *all* languages (non-Rust ones move with identical binaries; `n` shifts), so the Rust
  re-rank wobble (dev 69→72, held-out 64→59) is eval nondeterminism inside wide overlapping CIs,
  not a ranking change.
- **Scope honesty:** the variant *condition* is now path-based (Raw-free), but two copies that
  differ only in the *bound name* (`Some(a)` vs `Some(b)`) still split — the body's `a`/`b` are
  not alpha-canonicalized because tuple-struct bindings aren't registered as locals. Full
  whole-family convergence needs binding *extraction* (project the payload into a canonical
  local), a separate lever; an early test asserting that convergence was *falsified* and the
  claim dropped. This PR is the coverage fix, not the alpha-convergence fix.

Method: empirical leak isolation (probe each pattern position with `nose stats --format json`) pinned
the leak to the binding cases (match-arm / if-let / while-let), not let-destructuring, before
any edit. Re-run `coverage_attribution.py` to watch the ratio; next §CP levers: async `await`
(cross-language), rust `try`/`?`, and tuple-struct binding extraction (the alpha-convergence
follow-up).

## CR. The §CP worklist correction — boundary Raw vs lowering-gap Raw (#390, 2026-06-15)

Pursuing the §CP worklist's next levers exposed a flaw in the worklist itself: its top "Raw
mass" is dominated by **deliberate protocol boundaries**, not fixable lowering gaps. `await`,
`try`/`?`, `defer`, `go`, `channel_*`, `select`, `yield` all lower via `protocol_boundary` — a
`Raw` node that is a *fail-closed effect/protocol boundary* (async, channels, defer,
try-propagation, generators), kept "until a contract proves it can be erased safely." Erasing
them to cut Raw would be **unsound** (e.g. a `Future` is not its resolved value); that is the
deferred protocol-contract work, not a lowering fix. The §CP instrument counted them as fixable.

Fix: `nose stats` now classifies each `Raw` node as **protocol-boundary** (by design) or
**lowering-gap** (fixable), authoritatively — the frontend owns `PROTOCOL_BOUNDARY_TAGS`
(`is_protocol_boundary_tag`), and `protocol_boundary` `debug_assert!`s membership so a new
boundary tag can't silently misclassify (it caught `channel_receive_status` during this work).
`stats` JSON gains `boundary_raw` (overall + per-lang) and a `boundary: bool` per unhandled
kind; `coverage_attribution.py` reports the **gap** ratio (boundaries excluded).

**Corrected corpus picture** (`coverage_attribution.2026-06-15.json`, gap% = boundaries
excluded): rust raw 1.347% → **gap 0.372%**, go 0.650% → **gap 0.176%** — those languages are
essentially done; their residual Raw is `try`/`await`/`defer`/`channel`. The genuine fixable
gap is now led by **`ERROR` (tree-sitter parse failures, ~50k corpus-wide)** — a grammar axis,
not lowering — and **C type-level declarations** (`declaration`/`field_declaration`/`preproc_def`/
`pointer_declarator`/`type_definition`, ~42k; low clone-value), with a modest tail of JS/TS
statement wrappers (`statement_block`, `spread_element`) and java `variable_declarator`.
`expression_statement` is *not* a leak (a bare `f();` lowers to 0 Raw — its corpus count is
parse-error-adjacent).

**Verdict for #390.** The safe lowering headroom is now characterized and largely captured: the
biggest genuine accidental leak (Rust patterns) shipped in §CQ; after that, rust/go lowering is
near-complete and the remaining `Raw` is either deliberate boundaries (a separate, soundness-
contract-gated effort), parse failures (a grammar axis), or low-value type-level declarations.
Driving the *raw* ratio lower is mostly NOT a safe lowering task — the instrument now says so.

## CS. Value-graph coverage census — map reads are not an opaque gap (#391, 2026-06-15)

§CP/§CR characterized the **lowering** dimension (`Raw` nodes). The §CP note flagged a second,
unmeasured dimension: value-graph **modeling** loss (`ValOp::Opaque` fallbacks), the #391
collections/map question — `Opaque` carried no construct provenance, so attributing it needed
instrumentation. This is that instrument and its first measurement.

**Instrument.** A `cur_il_kind` field mirrors the existing `cur_span` (set by `eval`'s
save/restore), and `mk` records, into an env-gated census, every `ValOp::Opaque` it builds keyed
by `(IL construct, total-fallback)` — `total-fallback` = an argless opaque (a full coverage gap)
vs a semantic opaque with structure (`instanceof`). Zero fingerprint impact (inert when off;
equivalence/determinism unchanged). Surfaced as `nose value-census`; the corpus probe is
`bench/type4/value_graph_attribution.py`, the value-graph analog of `coverage_attribution.py`.

**The #391 premise was wrong.** The audit memory framed map reads as bailing to `Value::Err` —
but that is the *oracle* (`interp.rs`), not the *fingerprint*. In the value graph `m[k]` and
`m.get(k)` are both **modeled** (`Index` / `Call`) — they mint **no opaque** — but they get
**different fingerprints** (their normalized IL diverges). So #391 is a **convergence /
form-canonicalization** problem (`m[k]` ≡ `m.get(k)` ≡ `k in m`), not an opaque-coverage gap.

**Measured (py/js/go/rust subset, 6128 function units).** 27% of units carry ≥1 opaque. The
opaque mass is led by **`Raw` propagation** (1557 nodes / 906 units — the already-characterized
§CR lowering frontier, surfacing in the fingerprint), **`Block`** (1464 / 687 — unmodeled
statement blocks/closures), and **`Func`** (344 / 181 — nested functions). `BinOp`-semantic
opaques (`instanceof`/strict-null-cmp) and a small `Call`/`Splat`/`HoF`/`Loop` tail follow. The
map-read constructs **`Index` / `Field` / membership carry ~0 opaque mass** — confirming map
reads are not a value-graph coverage gap.

**Verdict for #391.** Modeling `Value::Map` reads would not reduce opaque mass; it is narrow
convergence work (canonicalize the read forms) with the soundness cost of key-equality /
missing-key / language-variance semantics, and `--falsify` cannot even construct an input for it.
With map reads below the opaque threshold, #391 is **audited, below the bar** — the value-graph
opaque worklist is `Block`/`Func` (closures/nested) and the propagated lowering `Raw` (already a
characterized, mostly-boundary/grammar frontier), not collections. The analysis engine remains at
its measured frontier.

## CT. Adversarial co-evolution, series 10 — the nullish-coalesce map-default false merge (#409)

One campaign (tracking #409), commit 9301beb, surfaces chosen by freshness: (S1) the
1-day-old Rust pattern lowering (#390 constructor-pattern-as-variant-test, #404 match-arm
payload binding — *merge-creating*, so soundness-class); (S2) the value-graph collection /
map-read model (#391/#405 §CS); (S3) the same-day tree-sitter grammar bumps (#406/#407,
c/python/javascript→0.25, go→0.25 `statement_list`, rust→0.24), priced as a measurement
because CI is rust-only. Two blind persona-rotated attackers (soundness-skeptic on S1,
language-specialist on S2); S3 run by the assessor.

**S1 — Rust pattern lowering: green.** The attacker reported two near-family merges
(variant-swap `route_first`/`route_second`; single-variant-token `select_foo`/`select_bar`).
On *isolated* reproduction both produced **zero families** — the reported merges were
contamination from extra harness files in the attacker's directory, and even as reported were
near-channel (`witness=similar`) with `verify` clean. The exact equivalence channel and the
field/payload projections held. The merge-creating #390/#404 rules came back clean.

**S2 — the priced packet: `m.get(k) ?? d` false-merges with the absence-only default.** A
real LATENT false merge (`witness=exact`). nose gives ONE fingerprint to the nullish-coalesce
`m.get(k) ?? d` (default on absent **or** present-null) and the genuine **absence** forms
`m.has(k) ? m.get(k) : d`, `m.get(k) === undefined ? d : g`, Python `d.get(k, d)`. They
diverge on a present key whose value is null: `Map<string, number|null>` with `m["x"]=null`
→ `??` gives `0`, presence gives `null` (verified with node). **Oracle-blind** — the
interpreter shares the null/undefined conflation, so `nose verify --max-violations 0` stays
green even as its own calibration prints `vj[1.0]: 0/1 = 0% behavior-equal`. The §AS scenario
again: only a crafted attack finds it.

Root cause has two coupled layers. `mk_value_or_map_default`
(`value_graph/collections.rs`) **upgrades** a null-guarded coalesce to the absence-only
`GetOrDefault`; and the value model **conflates `null` with `undefined`**
(`value_graph/eval/binary.rs`
comment), collapsing the true-absence `=== undefined` into the same `Eq(MapGet, null)` guard
as `?? `/`== null`. The membership guards (`has`/`in`) fold to `GetOrDefault` through a
separate, non-conflated path — they are the only forms the model can *prove* are absence.

**Defense: deferred (#410), and deliberately not patched.** The fold is uniform across map
kinds; soundness depends on the map's value-type **nullability**, which the IL erases. A blunt
fix (route the null-guard fold to the faithful `ValueOrDefault`) was built and measured — it
splits the attacker's parameter-map false merge, but it also **breaks the provably-sound
literal-map convergence** (`literal_map_default_lookup_converges_with_js_map_construction_boundaries`
in `crates/nose-cli/tests/equivalence/literal_map_defaults.rs`: `new Map([["red",1]]).get(k) ?? 0`
≡ the `has` form IS sound, the values are non-null literals — already a distinct fingerprint class),
and it cannot separate
`??` from `=== undefined` (both null-guards, conflated). The sound fix needs a *map-value
non-null proof* plus *null/undefined de-conflation* — value-model-core + interpreter work past
this campaign's surgical scope. Recorded as `bench/coevo/false_merges/map_nullish_default.ts`,
the third oracle-blind row beside `float_assoc.py` and `array_element_mutation.py`; see
oracle-value-model §7.4. Same disposition as §250's #269/#270 deferrals: a priced packet whose
sound defense exceeds scope closes as `deferred: #410` with fixture and measurement attached.

**S3 — grammar bumps: no regression surfaced** in the campaign's c/python/javascript/ts
fixtures (all parsed and lowered clean post-bump). The standing per-language validation
(per-language Raw-ratio + byte-identical `query top=0`, run against a pre-bump baseline binary)
remains the gate for the bumps, since the rust-only dogfood signal cannot see non-rust grammar
regressions.

**Lessons.** (1) A blind attacker's directory hygiene matters — S1's reported merges were a
scratch-dir contamination artifact; always reproduce a submitted packet in isolation before
pricing (the assessor's reproduction, not the attacker's report, is the verdict). (2) A
soundness fix that would break a *provably-sound* sibling merge is not the largest sound
generalization — it is the wrong axis; the value model must gain the missing proof
(nullability) first. The campaign found nothing it could ship and that is the green-with-teeth
result: one well-characterized latent false merge, scoped to #410.

**Resolution (#410, same session) — the deferral was lifted; the fix is corpus-inert.** The
defer reasoning had a measurement gap: it assumed splitting the coalesce form from the absence
form would cost real recall. It does not. The two GetOrDefault feeders are *separable without
any nullability proof*: the **membership** guard (`has`/`in`, and Java/Go/Rust/Python's typed
`getOrDefault`/comma-ok/`.get(k,d)`) folds to `GetOrDefault` through `map_presence_condition`,
a path the null/undefined conflation never touches; only the **null-equality** guard
(`?? `, `== null`) reached `GetOrDefault` via `mk_value_or_map_default`. The fix is two splits
that can only *remove* merges (never create one, so no new proof obligation): (1) route the
null-guarded map default to the faithful `ValueOrDefault` (`mk_nullish_map_default`) instead of
`GetOrDefault`; (2) drop the `value_graph/eval/binary.rs` `=== undefined`-over-map-get exception
so the strict guard stays a distinct opaque rather than the conflated null `Eq`. Result:
`{?? , == null}` = coalesce,
`{has, in, getOrDefault, .get(k,d), comma-ok, unwrap_or}` = absence, `=== undefined` = its own
opaque — all false merges gone, the coalesce and absence classes each still converge internally.
**Corpus impact: byte-identical** `query top=0 --format json` across 15 JS/TS repos (5825 families)
AND the Python/Java/Go/Rust repos — the lost merges (`?? `≡absence, `=== undefined`≡`has`) fire
only in the synthetic convergence tests, never on real code, so the "provably-sound literal
merge" the deferral worried about has zero real-world prevalence. Regression:
`nullish_coalesce_map_default_is_distinct_from_absence_default` in
`crates/nose-cli/tests/equivalence/map_default_boundaries.rs`; the cross-language and CLI
map-default tests now assert the sound partition (coalesce family distinct from absence).
**Lesson:** "soundness costs recall" is a hypothesis to *measure*, not assume — here the recall
cost was a synthetic-test artifact and the sound fix shipped clean. Residual (still #410, now a
pure recall enhancement): a map-value non-null proof would re-converge the coalesce forms with the
absence family where it is provably sound (literal non-null maps), and null/undefined de-conflation
would re-home `=== undefined` with the absence class — neither is a soundness obligation.

## CU. async↔sync twins — the dual-view await (the #1 Type-4 gap, §K)

§K named **async ↔ sync twins** "the real Type-4 gap in production code": an `async def f` and
its sync twin (identical body modulo `await`) are duplicated logic a maintainer would want
surfaced, but nose detected **0 families** for them (`async_sync_twin: none` in
`coverage_matrix.v1.json`). The convergence was deliberately gated: `await` lowers to a
`Raw("await")` protocol boundary the value graph turns into a **childless** `Opaque(subtree_hash)`
(`value_graph/eval/core.rs`), so twins share no value-DAG structure. Erasing `await` was the
*old* unsound path (it
removed the IL `Raw` → the unit became `exact_safe` → an exact false merge of a Future with its
resolved value).

**The channel was wrong.** async↔sync twins are NOT behaviorally equal (a coroutine ≠ a value), so
they belong in the **near/graded** channel (refactoring candidates — no equivalence claim), never
the exact channel. Two empirical findings shaped the mechanism: (1) a wrapper that keeps the await
visible **poisons downstream value identity** — `v = await f(x)` makes `v` the wrapper, so every
later `v+1` diverges from the sync twin's, and family formation is pure `vj`/`sj` scoring (the
witness only *labels*); so a wrapper alone never converges twins. (2) Full transparency (eval
`await e → e`) DOES converge them and stays exact-safe (the IL `Raw` keeps the unit non-`exact_safe`
— `strict_exact` returns false on `Raw` — so async units are excluded from exact families
regardless of the fingerprint). "Soundness costs recall" was again a hypothesis to measure: it
didn't, the exact channel is provably inert.

**The fix is a DUAL VIEW** of the value graph, keyed by `Builder.await_transparent`:
- **Fingerprint build** (default `true`): `await e` ≡ `e`'s value → an async fn's fingerprint
  matches its sync twin → they converge on `vj` in candidate mode.
- **ValueDag/witness build** (`false`, set in `value_dag()`): keeps an `Opaque(VG_PROTOCOL_AWAIT,[e])`
  wrapper so the graded witness *sees* the await. `Au::unify` aligns the wrapper against the bare
  operand on the sync side (recursing through it so the alignment propagates downstream), records a
  one-sided **`async-mirror`** hole, and forces `equal_modulo_holes = false` — a transformation
  twin is never an equivalence claim.

So scoring sees *through* await (twins converge) while the witness *sees* await (honest
`async-mirror` label + the precision gate). First increment: **Python + JS/TS** (both lower `await`
through `await_boundary`); Rust `.await` and the other protocol boundaries (`yield`/`try`-`?`/
channels — non-pass-through semantics) deferred.

**2026-06-30 follow-up: async protocol boundaries beyond JS/TS.** The same dual-view
mechanism now covers supported async protocol boundaries instead of a JS/TS/Python-only
`await` special case. Fingerprint builds look through `await`, `async_function`, and
`async_block` wrappers for near-channel candidate formation; value-DAG/witness builds keep
the wrapper so `async-mirror` remains explicit and `equal_modulo_holes=false`. This makes
Rust `.await`/`async fn` and Swift `await`/`async func` synthetic twins converge in
`near`/`spotclass=structural` while keeping exact admission closed. The synthetic gold set
now includes Rust and Swift total-loop pairs, and the focused query JSON regression asserts
that those pairs carry `async-mirror`/`equal_modulo_holes=false` evidence. The real-frontier
coverage matrix is not flipped for Rust or Swift until there is hand-verified real-corpus
evidence comparable to the httpx Python cases.

**Gates.** Full suite **1056 pass**; the dual-view broke no existing await test. **Exact-channel
provably inert:** `verify --max-violations 0` clean (axios/rxjs/trpc/flask/guava), and the
`exact-value-graph` families are **byte-identical** before/after on zod/prettier/flask/guava/gorm —
the change only ADDs near families. Deterministic. Tests: witness `async-mirror`/`both-sides-await`
units + an end-to-end detection test (twin converges, different-logic decoy excluded).

**Recall (eval substrate).** A first `production_async_sync` gold set — 6 Python+JS/TS twin pairs
(`bench/type4/fixtures/async_sync/`, gold `bench/labels/async_sync_twins.v1.json`) + 3
async-vs-different-logic hard-negatives — measured with `nose eval`: the `near_exact_or_structural`
twin recall goes **0/6 → 6/6** (baseline binary vs this change), **HN-FP 0/3**. (A 4th would-be
negative — two async fns differing only `+`/`-` — was dropped: candidate mode surfaces
same-shape-different-operator BY DESIGN, on the baseline too, so it is not an async-twin miss.)

**Real-corpus lift — measured, and modest.** Mining = run nose (with this feature) on
async/sync-mirror-rich repos and keep the families whose members span an `async def` and a plain
`def`. httpx (`Client`/`AsyncClient`) surfaces **8** such twin families, including the production
`Response.read` / `aread` (`_models.py:468`/`482`). But the **differential** (FIX vs the baseline
binary) is small: httpx **+1** new twin (`test_*_auth_reads_response_body`), scrapy re-grouped,
sqlalchemy +0 — because most real twins ALREADY converge via the sub-DAG/anchor path (their shared
non-await body is a big enough common anchor; `read`/`aread` itself converges on the baseline too).
So the synthetic 0→6/6 proves the *mechanism*; the marginal real-corpus recall is **+1-ish**, and
the durable wins are the explicit candidate-mode convergence + the honest `async-mirror` witness
label (which the anchor path does not give). The `coverage_matrix` `async_sync_twin` **python** cell
is flipped none→covered (evidence: the hand-verified httpx `read`/`aread`, `real_frontier.v1.json`).
Lesson, the twin of §CU's first: a new recall feature's *real-corpus lift* is also a hypothesis to
measure, not assume — here it is small.

**Follow-up (not soundness):** real-corpus evidence for the js/ts/rust/swift cells (js/ts libraries
keep parallel sync/async versions far less often than Python ones, so no clean mined twin yet),
and then broader protocol boundaries only when their runtime obligations are measurable.

## CV. Swift lowering gap tranche from app dogfood (#452, 2026-06-18)

The Swift app dogfood run made the Swift Raw tail concrete: baseline stats showed Swift at
**18,083 Raw / 325,423 nodes = 5.557%**, with `prefix_expression` alone contributing
**8,522** gap nodes. Inspecting the raw IL showed the dominant prefix shape was Swift's
implicit member shorthand (`.vertical`, `.named(...)`, `.top`, etc.), especially in SwiftUI
call sites. Treating that as an ordinary bare identifier would be unsound (`.vertical` is
contextual enum/member syntax, not `vertical`), but keeping it as a generic
`Raw("prefix_expression")` lost useful structure and made every shorthand look like the same
lowering gap.

**Fix shipped in this tranche.** Swift implicit member shorthand now lowers to a distinct
sentinel receiver shape (`swift_implicit_member.member`), so it is not equal to a bare variable
and does not claim a concrete enum type. Protocol function/property requirements also lower as
signature/declaration structure instead of raw protocol declaration nodes, which directly
addresses the protocol-heavy duplication seen in the dogfood app.

**Measured result.** Re-running the same dogfood command with the patched binary:

```text
swift 344 files · 330,442 nodes · 7,056 Raw · 2.135% raw · 2,062 boundary Raw
```

The total Swift Raw count drops **18,083 → 7,056** and `prefix_expression` /
`protocol_function_declaration` leave the top gap list. The remaining largest Swift gaps are
`value_binding_pattern` (1,963), `switch_pattern` (1,235), `enum_entry` (434),
`key_path_expression` (213), and `ternary_expression` (127). `await` and `try` remain protocol
boundaries, not lowering misses.

**Query quality check.** The Swift-only query check still leads with the previously hand-verified
refactoring candidates (`sectionTitle`, `CurrentTimeLineView`, `EventsView`, the low-shared
input/settings UI pattern, and `handleRecurringEventUpdate`), while the default Swift family count
moves from 415 to 388 because the implicit-member structure changes some structural similarity
grouping. This is acceptable for a lowering change; the top actionable signal did not disappear.

**Next safe tranche.** `value_binding_pattern` and `switch_pattern` need pattern-aware lowering,
not a blind Raw erase: `if let`, `case let`, wildcard, enum-associated-value, and binding
patterns carry different control-flow and binding semantics. They should be closed with focused
convergence fixtures before being generalized.

## CW. Markdown front-matter / comment stripping — measured NO-GO (2026-06-18)

After the multi-domain Markdown precision golden (`bench/markdown/golden.docs.v1`, PR-AUC 0.944)
landed, the natural next lever was stripping more *format scaffolding* in `nose-markdown::norm`:
YAML front matter (`---…---`) and HTML/license comments (`<!-- … -->`), on the same "format ≠
content" principle as the table-scaffolding strip. Hypothesis: templated CLI/API docs (curl
options, hugo functions) share large front-matter skeletons that inflate similarity between
*different* docs, hurting precision.

**Measured on `golden.docs.v1`** (only the score changes; golden labels are fixed):

| variant | PR-AUC | ROC | R@P95 | candidate-recall |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| baseline | 0.944 | 0.970 | 0.737 | 1.00 |
| front-matter + comment | 0.446 | 0.507 | 0.053 | **0.368** |
| front-matter only | 0.919 | 0.989 | 0.763 | 1.00 |

**NO-GO.** Comment stripping is catastrophic for recall (1.00 → 0.37): golden positives rest on
shared license/copyright comments, so removing them destroys real matches — and having nose decide
a shared license header "doesn't count" is judgement-deep, not ours. Front-matter-only is a wash on
the primary metric (PR-AUC 0.944 → 0.919; ROC and R@P95 nudge up, recall preserved) and discards
real metadata (titles/descriptions). Neither is a measured gain, so the current normalization stands.

**What the golden actually proved.** There is no cheap precision win to chase here. The residual
multi-domain gap (PR-AUC 0.944, R@P95 0.74) is largely the irreducible judgement-deep zone:
templated docs that are genuinely surface-similar but document different things. nose correctly
*surfaces* those (relation score + span witness + commonness + the `template` flag) and leaves the
worth-it call to the maintainer — bending the engine to push that number up would be exactly the
judgement-deep work nose does not do.

## CX. Markdown query performance on a large wiki (2026-06-18)

A large symlinked Obsidian-style wiki (9,454 Markdown files, 11,389 files total) exposed the first
real scale cost of the Markdown `nose query` domain. Baseline release run:
`nose query <wiki-root>/` took **117.26s real / 113.92s user**, with **~1.29GB peak RSS**, and
reported **284 Markdown near-duplicate families** (35 templated). The code-clone corpus was empty
(`scanned 0 files`), so the cost was isolated to `nose-markdown`.

**Profiler result.** A 20s macOS `sample` run showed the dominant stack in
`nose_markdown::verify::CorpusModel::tfidf_cosine`: every candidate pair recomputed both unit
vector norms by scanning all shingles and doing IDF `HashMap` lookups. The rayon worker threads
were idle during this phase, so the Markdown verifier was also leaving available CPU parallelism
unused. A smaller secondary cost was candidate-pair set construction through ordered maps.

**Fix shipped.** `CorpusModel::fit` now precomputes per-unit TF-IDF weights and vector norms once;
candidate verification uses those cached vectors. Fingerprints are built and candidate pairs are
verified through rayon while preserving deterministic candidate order. Stage-1 maps use the
workspace's fast deterministic hash maps/sets, and char-n-gram hashing no longer materializes a
temporary `String` for every gram.

**Measured result.** Re-running the same release command took **10.12s real / 48.23s user** with
the output byte-identical to baseline (`cmp` clean): still **284 Markdown families** and the same
dashboard rows. Follow-up: peak RSS is still about **1.28GB**, so the next performance frontier is
memory pressure in candidate generation and witness bookkeeping, not relation scoring.

## CY. Corpus query performance pass after the wiki fix (2026-06-18)

After the wiki-scale Markdown fix, a representative pinned-corpus pass covered Python, Go,
Java, Rust, TypeScript/JavaScript, C, CSS, Svelte, and Markdown-heavy repos:
`sympy`, `hugo`, `prettier`, `netty`, `guava`, `svelte-core`, `curl`, `tokio`, `raylib`, and
`bulma`. Every final run was byte-identical to the pre-change report (`cmp` clean).

**Profiler result.** `NOSE_TIME=1` showed code-heavy repos dominated by `normalize+extract`.
macOS `sample` on `raylib` confirmed that the hot normalization path is value-graph work inside
large vendored C headers (`miniaudio.h`, `RGFW.h`, etc.), especially parameter-domain seeding and
value fingerprint construction. That is soundness-sensitive code; no change shipped there.

The actionable repeated cost was the contiguous copy-paste channel on C/CSS-heavy repos. A late
sample during `raylib` showed time in `nose_detect::contiguous::loc`: for every accepted token run,
the detector rebuilt full `Loc` objects and cloned path strings before deduplication, while also
rescanning the token slice for line min/max.

**Fix shipped.** The contiguous detector now keeps internal `(stream, start, end)` span seeds,
dedups before constructing user-facing `Loc`s, and uses a small per-stream line-range index for
long token-run span lookup. Candidate selection, clustering, and report ordering are unchanged.

**Measured result.** Representative final release runs:

| repo | baseline real | final real | notable stage change |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `raylib` | 8.17s | 4.80s | contiguous **1011ms → 458ms** |
| `bulma` | 3.67s | 2.69s | contiguous **1479ms → 912ms** |
| `sympy` | 8.16s | 4.22s | contiguous **258ms → 130ms**; normalization remains the main cost |
| `guava` | 4.43s | 3.07s | contiguous **86ms → 39ms** |

The larger wall-time drops also include warm-cache and run-to-run effects, so the durable claim is
the stage-local contiguous reduction plus byte-identical output. `normalize+extract` remains the
real frontier for large C/Python/Java repos, but the next change there should be evidence-backed
deduplication of value-graph work, not local micro-optimization.

## CZ. Corpus query speed budget pass (2026-06-19)

Goal: make `nose query bench/repos/<repo>` finish under **4s for every checked-out corpus repo**
with a release build, without leaning on local micro-optimizations. The final saved run is
`target/corpus-query-speed-release-0.13.3/summary.tsv`.

**Baseline symptoms.** The first full pass had three repos over budget: `alamofire` **8.994s**,
`sympy` **4.673s**, and `raylib` **4.669s**; `curl` was close at **3.793s**. `NOSE_TIME=1`
showed different bottlenecks per repo:

| repo | dominant cost |
|---|---|
| `alamofire` | family ranking dedup compared candidates against too many already-kept families |
| `raylib` | block-unit expansion/value extraction inside huge vendored C headers |
| `sympy` | normalization/extraction over large data-like formulas and large test fixtures |
| `curl` | Markdown dashboard candidate verification over 920 Markdown files |

**Fixes shipped.**

- Ranking dedup now indexes kept family spans by file and only calls exact subsumption when the
  first site can actually overlap. This changes the search shape, not the ranking semantics.
- Generated-source classification scans only files that occur in reported families, and non-CSS
  generated-header checks read only the first 64 KiB. CSS still reads the full file because compiled
  CSS detection needs source-map and minification evidence.
- Bulk dependency and very large files still keep function/method/class units, but no longer expand
  every nested block into extra semantic block units; exact copy-paste remains covered by the syntax
  channel.
- Dense generated/data-like mega-functions are excluded from semantic value extraction when they are
  extremely token-dense; exact syntax matches still surface them.
- Large test fixture files skip semantic value extraction and stay syntax-covered. Small tests still
  participate in semantic matching, preserving the normal test-code signal and existing CLI
  semantics.
- Shared-line IDF now reads/splits files in parallel while preserving deterministic aggregation.
- Query reports skip raw accepted-pair materialization and sorting; hidden `nose detect` and library
  callers keep the pair list for research and compatibility.
- Markdown verification computes TF-IDF cosine, containment, and shared-gram substance in one
  sorted-set pass per candidate. It also keeps stop-bucket guards for ubiquitous LSH/winnow grams,
  reducing the `curl` dashboard without suppressing true duplicate families.
- Bulk query JSON rendering now reuses a single source-line cache for all-copies `params` /
  shared-line evidence, preserving byte-identical JSON while avoiding a full file reread and
  anti-unification setup per reported family.

**Measured result.** Final release-build corpus pass, sequential per repo:

| metric | value |
|---|---:|
| repos | 150 |
| failures | 0 |
| repos >= 4s | 0 |
| total wall time | 82.063s |
| max repo | `sympy` 3.989s |

Top final repo times:

| repo | seconds |
|---|---:|
| `sympy` | 3.989 |
| `guava` | 3.362 |
| `raylib` | 3.160 |
| `libgdx` | 3.030 |
| `netty` | 2.544 |
| `h2database` | 2.502 |
| `nushell` | 2.266 |
| `rxjava` | 2.247 |
| `sqlalchemy` | 2.022 |
| `swift-nio` | 1.943 |

Representative stage checks after the changes: `curl` Markdown `md_accept` dropped from about
**2108ms** to **538ms** in the Markdown pass; bulk JSON `query_render` then dropped from
**5284.7ms** to **67.3ms** on `raylib`, **778.7ms** to **166.7ms** on `sympy`, and
**3124.8ms** to **87.9ms** on `bulma`, with byte-identical JSON for those three checks. Relevant
tests: `cargo test -p nose-markdown`, `cargo test -p nose-detect`, and `cargo test -p nose-cli`.

## DA. Language lowering gap tranche: Swift, JS/TS, C, CSS (2026-06-20)

The §CR boundary-vs-gap split made the next worklist concrete: do not chase protocol boundaries,
and do not paper over tree-sitter `ERROR`; close genuine lowering gaps where a CST surface has a
meaningful fail-closed IL shape. This tranche worked the four largest actionable fronts in order:
Swift pattern/key-path/range surfaces, JS/TS object and unary surfaces, C type/preprocessor-adjacent
surfaces, and CSS extension bookkeeping.

**Baseline.** Full pinned `bench/repos` stats before the tranche:

```text
files: 67407   IL nodes: 46131611   Raw nodes: 381447 (0.827%)
= 265323 lowering-gap + 116124 protocol-boundary
```

Worst fixable gaps were C type/preprocessor surfaces (88,383), Swift pattern/member surfaces
(61,955), JavaScript/TypeScript object and expression wrappers (47,933 combined), and a small CSS
tail where non-standard PostCSS surfaces were counted as lowering gaps.

**Fixes shipped.**

- Swift: `enum_entry`, `value_binding_pattern`, `switch_pattern`, key paths, and range operators now
  lower to explicit Swift shapes instead of generic `Raw` wrappers. Pattern lowering is deliberately
  exact-closed; it preserves structure without claiming full binding/control-flow equivalence.
- JS/TS: object spread, computed property names, object methods, `void`, `delete`, JSX element
  wrappers, and class-expression wrappers now lower to structured nodes. This removes wrapper Raw
  cascades that hid method bodies and ordinary object-literal structure.
- C: compound literals and type/preprocessor surfaces no longer leak as lowering gaps, and parser
  `ERROR` recovery now lowers recognizable declaration/function/statement children under the error
  parent. The `ERROR` node itself remains Raw, which keeps the parse boundary honest.
- CSS: PostCSS/import/declaration bookkeeping that does not affect computed-style fingerprints is
  skipped, while nested at-rules are routed through the CSS rule lowering path. Remaining CSS Raw in
  the pinned corpus is essentially parser `ERROR`.

**Measured result.** Re-running `cargo run -q -p nose-cli -- stats bench/repos --top 60`:

```text
files: 67407   IL nodes: 46064044   Raw nodes: 250829 (0.545%)
= 134722 lowering-gap + 116107 protocol-boundary
```

| language | gap before | gap after | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Swift | 61,955 | 33,598 | -28,357 |
| JavaScript | 26,430 | 10,881 | -15,549 |
| TypeScript | 21,503 | 5,233 | -16,270 |
| C | 88,383 | 18,192 | -70,191 |
| CSS | 3,230 | 2,996 | -234 |

Overall lowering-gap Raw drops **265,323 -> 134,722** (-130,601, about 49%). The residual top gaps
are now dominated by parse-owned `ERROR`, existing protocol boundaries (`await`, `try`, `defer`,
channel/select/yield), and a few language-specific tails such as Swift directives/macro call
surfaces and Python line continuations.

**Regression coverage.** Focused tests were added for each tranche surface, then the frontend and
CLI guardrails were run:

```text
cargo test -q -p nose-frontend
cargo test -q -p nose-cli --test equivalence
cargo test -q -p nose-cli --test css_html_quality
```

## DB. Language lowering residual tranche: Python, Java, Swift (2026-06-20)

The §DA pass left a much smaller and more actionable tail: Python explicit line continuations,
Java declaration/module surfaces, and Swift macro/directive/accessor/operator cascades. The rule
stayed the same: close CST wrappers that have a fail-closed IL shape, but do not erase parser-owned
`ERROR` nodes or protocol boundaries.

**Baseline.** Full pinned `bench/repos` stats before this follow-up:

```text
files: 67407   IL nodes: 46064044   Raw nodes: 250829 (0.545%)
= 134722 lowering-gap + 116107 protocol-boundary
```

Language gaps most relevant to this pass were Python **12,100**, Java **19,533**, and Swift
**33,598**. In focused subsets, SymPy alone had 8,770 Python `line_continuation` Raw nodes, the
Java-heavy subset had 15,554 Java gaps, and the Swift subset had 27,682 Swift gaps dominated by
directives, macro call suffixes, computed accessors, overflow operators, special literals, and
fully-open ranges.

**Fixes shipped.**

- Python: `line_continuation` is now filtered from semantic child traversal and comparison
  iteration, so explicit backslashes no longer become semantic Raw nodes in asserts,
  comprehensions, and other nested expressions.
- Java: constants, enum body declarations, static initializers, compact constructors, module
  directives, labeled/assert/synchronized statements, scoped type identifiers, and unsigned
  shift-right operators now lower to structured or exact-closed IL. Java `>>>` stays distinct from
  signed `>>`.
- Swift: macro invocations and diagnostics no longer leak `call_suffix` / `value_argument`
  wrappers; computed property accessors lower through their statement bodies; Swift-specific
  identity and overflow/custom operators, special literals, fully-open ranges, and conditional
  compilation directives lower to Swift-specific exact-closed nodes.

**Measured result.** Re-running `cargo run -q -p nose-cli -- stats bench/repos --top 100`:

```text
files: 67407   IL nodes: 46051702   Raw nodes: 199028 (0.432%)
= 82886 lowering-gap + 116142 protocol-boundary
```

| language | gap before | gap after | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Python | 12,100 | 3,320 | -8,780 |
| Java | 19,533 | 2,204 | -17,329 |
| Swift | 33,598 | 7,871 | -25,727 |

Overall lowering-gap Raw drops **134,722 -> 82,886** (-51,836). The full-corpus top gaps are now
mostly tree-sitter `ERROR` recovery across C/JS/TS/Go/Swift/Python/Java, plus known protocol
boundaries (`await`, `try`, `defer`, `go`, channel/select, `yield`). A targeted Swift check on
`swift-log/Sources/Logging/Locks.swift` confirms conditional compilation `directive` Raw is gone
there; the remaining gap in that file is parser `ERROR`, so it stays honest Raw.

**Regression coverage.** Focused failing tests were added before each fix, then the final guardrails
were run:

```text
cargo test -q -p nose-frontend python::tests -- --nocapture
cargo test -q -p nose-frontend java::tests -- --nocapture
cargo test -q -p nose-frontend swift::tests -- --nocapture
cargo test -q -p nose-frontend

cargo test -q -p nose-cli --test css_html_quality
awiki lint --root docs
```

## DH. Parser-artifact hygiene and unsupported-header routing (2026-06-20)

After §DG, the largest `gap-impact` rows were no longer ordinary lowering misses. They were parser
`ERROR` rows dominated by files that should not have reached the supported-language parsers at all:
ANSI-highlighted syntax-test output carrying real source suffixes, binary test assets such as a
PNG named `fake.js`, and C++ headers routed to the C frontend through `.h`.

**Baseline.**

```text
files: 67407   IL nodes: 46113701   Raw nodes: 181168
= 60332 lowering-gap + 120836 intentional-boundary
parser ERROR Raw: 56895
```

The largest parser-error rows were C `ERROR` (18,124 Raw; samples under
`antlr4/runtime/Cpp/.../*.h`), JavaScript `ERROR` (9,923 Raw; `bat` highlighted output plus
Prettier fixtures), Swift `ERROR` (5,145 Raw; mostly `bat` highlighted output), TypeScript `ERROR`
(4,302 Raw; mostly `bat` highlighted output), Go `ERROR` (3,931 Raw; `bat` highlighted output plus
etcd), and Python/Ruby/Rust/Java/CSS `ERROR` rows similarly inflated by highlighted or malformed
fixtures.

**Fixes shipped.**

- Source-extension files that contain binary-source evidence are skipped before lowering. The
  guard is intentionally narrow: NUL bytes or common binary file magic (PNG/JPEG/GIF/PDF/ZIP).
- ANSI-highlighted output files are skipped when repeated raw CSI escape sequences appear in the
  source bytes. This catches syntax-highlighting fixtures without relying on a project-specific
  `bat/tests/syntax-tests/highlighted` path.
- `.h` files still route to C by default, but a header that strongly looks like C++ (`namespace`,
  `template`, `class`, `std::`, or access specifiers after comments/strings are masked) is skipped
  instead of being parsed as C. This is a dialect-routing guard, not C++ support.

**Measured result.**

```text
files: 66916   IL nodes: 45852725   Raw nodes: 149276
= 28444 lowering-gap + 120832 intentional-boundary
parser ERROR Raw: 25219
```

Overall lowering-gap Raw drops **60,332 -> 28,444** (-31,888, -52.9%). Parser `ERROR` Raw drops
**56,895 -> 25,219** (-31,676, -55.7%). The file count drops by 491 because these artifacts are
not source analysis inputs.

| language | baseline `ERROR` Raw | post `ERROR` Raw | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| C | 18,124 | 13,531 | -4,593 |
| CSS | 2,991 | 2,040 | -951 |
| Go | 3,931 | 708 | -3,223 |
| HTML | 2,781 | 2,781 | 0 |
| Java | 2,073 | 5 | -2,068 |
| JavaScript | 9,923 | 4,917 | -5,006 |
| Python | 2,599 | 31 | -2,568 |
| Ruby | 2,632 | 23 | -2,609 |
| Rust | 2,394 | 369 | -2,025 |
| Swift | 5,145 | 725 | -4,420 |
| TypeScript | 4,302 | 89 | -4,213 |

The residual top parser rows are now mostly real unsupported or intentionally malformed inputs:
C `ERROR` in Vim/libsodium/sqlite/raylib/curl, JavaScript `ERROR` concentrated in Prettier parser
fixtures, HTML malformed pages, CSS Less/error fixtures, Go etcd tests, and Swift real-source parser
tails. Those are a different work item from corpus hygiene.

## DG. Python/Go gap-impact tranche — close lexical and type-surface tails (2026-06-20)

After §DF, the actionable worklist was thin enough that a language-specific pass needed a
corpus-backed reason to exist. `nose gap-impact` still showed two Python rows and several Go
type-surface rows with meaningful affected-unit counts, so this pass targeted Python comments and
dictionary unpacking plus Go type-switch/type-syntax residue.

**Baseline.**

```text
files: 67407   IL nodes: 46110621   Raw nodes: 181552
= 61092 lowering-gap + 120460 intentional-boundary
```

The selected rows were:

| language | surface | raw | files | units | score |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Go | `pointer_type` | 251 | 27 | 65 | 2316.2 |
| Python | `comment` | 158 | 76 | 76 | 3435.7 |
| Python | `dictionary_splat` | 145 | 56 | 69 | 2917.9 |
| Go | `type_identifier` | 93 | 16 | 19 | 660.9 |
| Go | `type_instantiation_expression` | 61 | 20 | 21 | 754.9 |
| Go | `parenthesized_type` | 21 | 8 | 15 | 426.4 |
| Go | `slice_type` / `map_type` / `qualified_type` | 31 | 18 | 22 | 492.7 |

**Fixes shipped.**

- Python comments and explicit line continuations are filtered as lexical trivia wherever
  semantic children are collected. Comments inside parenthesized expression lists no longer
  introduce executable Raw.
- Python dictionary unpack entries (`{**base}`) no longer appear as `Raw("dictionary_splat")`.
  They lower to a Python-specific exact-closed surface so strict exact matching rejects the dict
  as unsupported instead of silently pretending that unpacking is ordinary key/value insertion.
- Go type-switch labels consume every type-only label, including multi-label cases, and keep each
  label as an intentional fail-closed `type_case ...` test. Remaining type labels no longer leak
  into case bodies as `pointer_type`, `type_identifier`, `slice_type`, `map_type`, or qualified
  type Raw.
- Go parser-ambiguous `type_instantiation_expression` now lowers value-position ambiguity as an
  index chain, preserving nested reads such as `sm.SymbolsForSource[ref.SourceIndex][ref.InnerIndex]`.
  Call-position type arguments are preserved as indexed callee structure instead of being
  collapsed without declaration facts, because names like `int`, `I`, `local`, or `pkg.Type` can be values as well as
  type names. The final review pass also caught that tree-sitter wraps some parser-ambiguous
  indexes in `type_arguments`/`type_elem`, and that single-argument indexed function calls like
  `fs[i](x)` can parse as `type_conversion_expression`. The wrappers are unwrapped before
  lowering, while the conversion/call ambiguity is kept as a fail-closed
  `go_type_conversion_or_index_call` surface instead of collapsing to the argument.

**Measured result.**

```text
files: 67407   IL nodes: 46113701   Raw nodes: 181168
= 60332 lowering-gap + 120836 intentional-boundary
```

Overall lowering-gap Raw drops **61,092 -> 60,332** (-760). Total Raw drops
**181,552 -> 181,168** (-384); the smaller total reduction is expected because Go type-switch
labels and Python dictionary unpack surfaces remain fail-closed intentional boundaries rather than
being treated as exact runtime semantics.

| language | surface | baseline raw | post raw | delta |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Go | `pointer_type` | 251 | 0 | -251 |
| Python | `comment` | 158 | 0 | -158 |
| Python | `dictionary_splat` | 145 | 0 | -145 |
| Go | `type_identifier` | 93 | 0 | -93 |
| Go | `type_instantiation_expression` | 61 | 0 | -61 |
| Go | `parenthesized_type` | 21 | 0 | -21 |
| Go | `slice_type` | 16 | 0 | -16 |
| Go | `map_type` | 9 | 0 | -9 |
| Go | `qualified_type` | 6 | 0 | -6 |

**Performance gate.** The same release commands completed with these post-run wall times:

| command | after |
|---|---:|
| `nose stats bench/repos --top 40` | 19.90s |
| `nose gap-impact bench/repos --top 40` | 21.97s |
| `nose query bench/repos/sympy --format json` | 3.80s |
| `nose query bench/repos/raylib --format json` | 3.25s |
| `nose query bench/repos/alacritty --format json` | 0.19s |

The pass is reported as a lowering-coverage improvement, not a speedup claim. The modified paths
are frontend lowering and exact-safety tests; no query or corpus scheduler path changed.

## DF. Rust/TypeScript/Swift/Go gap-impact tranche — close 1-4 together (2026-06-20)

After §DE, `nose gap-impact` still showed a thin but measurable set of safe language rows below
the parser-error block. The request for this pass was to do the next four rows together rather
than spinning a separate Go-only loop, but still keep the same discipline: quantify first, use
independent review for the language semantics, add focused tests before trusting the corpus
number, and finish with docs plus a release performance gate.

**Baseline.**

```text
files: 67407   IL nodes: 46107930   Raw nodes: 182575 (0.396%)
= 65429 lowering-gap + 117146 intentional-boundary
```

Baseline release timings were `stats_all` **27.44s**, `gap_impact_all` **28.38s**,
`query_sympy` **5.32s**, `query_raylib` **3.87s**, and `query_alacritty` **0.30s** wall time.
The chosen rows were Rust `let_condition`, TypeScript decorators/class static blocks, Swift
operator and statement-label tails, and Go type-switch/goto/fallthrough surfaces. They were
selected because they were broad enough to matter, but local enough to lower or classify without
inventing runtime type or whole-CFG analysis.

**Fixes shipped.**

- Rust: `let_condition` now lowers in expression position, and `let_chain` folds every named
  conjunct with boolean `And` instead of keeping only the final value. This preserves leading
  `if let ... && guard` conditions instead of silently dropping them.
- TypeScript/JavaScript: decorators lower to exact-closed `js_decorator` / `js_decorated_definition`
  surfaces, class static blocks lower to `js_class_static_block`, and decorated runtime
  definitions emit a source binding fact. Strict exact now treats that fact as a binding boundary,
  so a decorator that replaces a function/class cannot be proven as a direct exact call target.
  Decorators on erased type-only members are kept from attaching to the following runtime member.
- Swift: operator references and custom operators lower to exact-closed Swift operator surfaces
  instead of common `BinOp` nodes; prefix operators only map to shared unary semantics on exact
  operator spelling; statement labels and labeled `break`/`continue` are preserved as fail-closed
  label boundaries.
- Go: type-switch case type rows are reported as intentional `type_case ...` boundaries,
  `fallthrough` stays a fail-closed boundary, and `goto` / labels preserve the target spelling as
  source-backed boundaries instead of leaking `label_name` Raw inside executable bodies.

**Measured result.**

```text
files: 67407   IL nodes: 46110621   Raw nodes: 181552 (0.394%)
= 61092 lowering-gap + 120460 intentional-boundary
```

Overall lowering-gap Raw drops **65,429 -> 61,092** (-4,337). Total Raw drops more modestly,
**182,575 -> 181,552** (-1,023), because this pass intentionally moved several control-flow and
type-case surfaces from actionable gaps into source-preserving fail-closed boundaries. The main
target rows changed as follows in the lowering-gap accounting:

| language | surface | gap Raw before | gap Raw after |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| Rust | `let_condition` | 118 | 0 |
| TypeScript | `decorator` | 308 | 0 |
| TypeScript | `class_static_block` | 48 | 0 |
| Swift | `+` / `==` / `/` operator refs | 344 | 0 |
| Swift | `prefix_expression` | 38 | 0 |
| Swift | `statement_label` | 68 | 0 |
| Swift | `custom_operator` | 14 | 0 |
| Go | `type_case string` / `int64` / `map[string]any` | 193 | 0 |
| Go | `fallthrough_statement` | 86 | 0 |
| Go | `goto_statement` / `label_name` | 379 | 0 |

Language gap deltas from `nose stats` were Go **7,601 -> 4,496** (-3,105), Swift
**6,580 -> 6,015** (-565), TypeScript **5,233 -> 4,771** (-462), Rust **2,697 -> 2,573** (-124),
and JavaScript **10,881 -> 10,800** (-81) from the shared JS/TS lowering path.

**Performance gate.** The same release binary and workspace showed no slowdown:

| command | before | after |
|---|---:|---:|
| `nose stats bench/repos --top 40` | 27.44s | 18.14s |
| `nose gap-impact bench/repos --top 40` | 28.38s | 19.41s |
| `nose query bench/repos/sympy --format json` | 5.32s | 3.18s |
| `nose query bench/repos/raylib --format json` | 3.87s | 2.61s |
| `nose query bench/repos/alacritty --format json` | 0.30s | 0.13s |

As with the earlier lowering loops, treat the lower wall times as a regression check rather than a
claimed speedup; the code change was about coverage and sound boundaries, not performance.

**Review catches.** The Rust/TypeScript review identified the real Rust `let_chain` bug: only the
last conjunct was being lowered. It also required decorated TypeScript roots to fail closed in
strict exact. The Swift/Go review required exact-closed Swift operator references and preserving
Go/Swift label targets as boundaries. A final self-review caught a decorator edge case where a
decorator before an erased TypeScript member could otherwise drift onto the next runtime member;
that was fixed with a focused test. The final blocking review also caught decorated class-expression
unit roots and Swift `/Action.view` case paths losing source identity; both now have targeted
frontend/detect regression coverage.

**Regression coverage.**

```

**Next safe tranche.** Parser `ERROR` rows still dominate the absolute ranking, but the next
actionable non-parser candidates are Python `comment` / `dictionary_splat`, Go `pointer_type` /
`type_identifier` / generic type-instantiation tails, JavaScript `formal_parameters`, Ruby
`body_statement` / `retry`, and Swift `pattern`. The Go type-surface rows look like the most
direct continuation if the goal is to keep shrinking gap-impact without first tackling parser
recovery.

## DE. Ruby/Rust/Swift gap-impact tranche — close the next safe rows (2026-06-20)

After §DD, the remaining worklist was dominated by parser `ERROR` rows and a smaller set of
high-impact language surfaces. We kept the same measured workflow: capture a release baseline,
choose only high-impact non-parser rows with local semantics, review with independent subagents,
then re-run coverage, tests, docs lint, and the release performance gate before merging.

**Baseline.**

```text
files: 67407   IL nodes: 46087790   Raw nodes: 185458 (0.402%)
= 68312 lowering-gap + 117146 intentional-boundary
```

Baseline release timings were `stats_all` **16.27s**, `gap_impact_all` **17.86s**,
`query_sympy` **2.83s**, `query_raylib` **2.53s**, and `query_alacritty` **0.18s** wall time.
The top safe non-parser candidates were Ruby `binary =~` / `binary ===` / `then` / exception
clause spillover, Rust `crate` / `super` / shorthand field surfaces, and Swift
`selector_expression` / local `typealias_declaration`. Go type-case/goto/fallthrough and broad
Swift operator rows were deliberately deferred because they need runtime type or CFG semantics.

**Fixes shipped.**

- Ruby: `=~`, `!~`, `===`, and `<=>` now lower as Ruby method-call shape
  `Call(Field("<op>", receiver), arg)`, not as shared value equality. `case x; when p` now uses
  `p === x`, expression-position `case` uses the same lowering as statement `case`, and block
  bodies with `rescue` / `else` / `ensure` reuse the existing `Try` lowering without wrapping the
  block in an implicit `Return`.
- Rust: macro token roots `crate` and `super` lower to source-preserving `Var` atoms inside the
  existing fail-closed macro boundary. Struct literal shorthand preserves the shorthand value, and
  mutable shorthand field patterns project `value.field` into the local binding instead of leaking
  `mutable_specifier` / `shorthand_field_identifier` Raw.
- Swift: selector literals lower to an exact-closed `swift_selector_expression` surface carrying
  the source text, and local function-body `typealias` declarations are erased as type-only syntax.

**Measured result.**

```text
files: 67407   IL nodes: 46107930   Raw nodes: 182575 (0.396%)
= 65429 lowering-gap + 117146 intentional-boundary
```

Overall lowering-gap Raw drops **68,312 -> 65,429** (-2,883). The affected language gaps were:
Ruby **4,514 -> 2,923** (-1,591), Rust **3,699 -> 2,697** (-1,002), and Swift **6,870 -> 6,580**
(-290). The remaining top actionable non-parser rows are now Rust `let_condition`, Python
`comment`, Go type-case rows, TypeScript decorators, Swift operator rows, Go
`fallthrough`/`goto`, Swift statement labels, Ruby `body_statement`/`retry`, and Go
type-instantiation/type-case tails; parser `ERROR` rows still dominate the absolute top.

**Performance gate.** The initial post-run absolute timings were higher than the baseline
(`stats_all` **24.46s**, `gap_impact_all` **23.34s**, `query_sympy` **4.03s**, `query_raylib`
**3.71s**, `query_alacritty` **0.23s**), so we controlled for machine-state drift by building
`origin/main` in a separate worktree and measuring both binaries in the same state. Same-state
A/B did not show a systematic code regression:

| command | current | origin/main |
|---|---:|---:|
| `nose stats bench/repos --top 40` | 23.23s | 24.39s |
| `nose gap-impact bench/repos --top 40` | 24.69s | 24.48s |
| `nose query bench/repos/sympy --format json` | 4.04s | 4.69s |
| repeated `nose query bench/repos/raylib --format json` | 3.34s | 3.37s |
| repeated `nose query bench/repos/alacritty --format json` | 0.14s | 0.14s |

**Review catches.** The Ruby reviewer found no blocking issue after the operator/case shape was
changed to method-call semantics, but noted that bare tail-position method `case` still follows
the broader existing Ruby implicit-return policy. The Rust/Swift reviewer found two blocking Rust
test gaps: struct literal shorthand was still absent from the returned literal, and mutable
shorthand field patterns lacked the projection assignment. Both were fixed with stronger tests
before the final run.

## DD. Quantified 10-loop lowering tranche — stop treating every Raw as equal (2026-06-20)

After §DC, the user-facing question was no longer "can we lower more?" but "which remaining
lowering work has measurable value?" We therefore ran a fixed 10-loop pass from the checked-out
`bench/repos` corpus: measure performance first, choose high-impact non-parser rows from
`nose gap-impact`, implement only local semantics-preserving changes, review with independent
subagents, then re-run full coverage and the same performance commands before merging.

**Baseline.**

```text
files: 67407   IL nodes: 46051702   Raw nodes: 193349
= 77207 lowering-gap + 116142 protocol-boundary
```

The top non-parser candidates were Rust `macro_rule_body`, Ruby `binary`/`then`/`rescue`/
`string_content`/`lambda`, Swift `case`/`ternary_expression`/`availability_condition`, and Go
`pointer_type`/`type_identifier`/`iota`/type-switch surfaces. Baseline release timings were:
`stats_all` **40.73s**, `gap_impact_all` **32.83s**, `query_sympy` **5.74s**, `query_raylib`
**4.62s**, and `query_alacritty` **0.29s** wall time.

**Fixes shipped.**

- Go: type-switch case type nodes are excluded from case bodies, and const `iota` lowers to
  concrete spec ordinals, including nested conversion/call operands and omitted const values.
- Ruby: method-level rescue/ensure now lowers as a `Try` returned from the normal `Func -> Block`
  body shape; expression rescue, class variables, character literals, subshells, arrow lambdas,
  interpolated strings/symbols, keyword `and`/`or`, and loop modifiers no longer leak parser Raw.
  `begin ... end while/until` keeps post-test semantics by emitting a body prelude plus a loop.
- Swift: `if case` lowers to equality-style pattern tests, including compound trailing
  conditions; nil-branch ternaries lower to `If`; `@unknown default` and empty `catch` blocks no
  longer leak switch/catch wrappers.
- Boundary classification: Rust `macro_rule_body` and Swift `availability_condition` remain
  fail-closed Raw, but are classified as intentional syntax/preprocessor boundaries rather than
  actionable lowering gaps. `gap-impact` JSON now reports `intentional_boundary_raw`.

**Measured result.**

```text
files: 67407   IL nodes: 46087790   Raw nodes: 185458 (0.402%)
= 68312 lowering-gap + 117146 intentional-boundary
```

Overall lowering-gap Raw drops **77,207 -> 68,312** (-8,895). The language gaps most affected:
Go **10,724 -> 7,601** (-3,123), Ruby **8,427 -> 4,514** (-3,913), Swift **7,871 -> 6,870**
(-1,001), and Rust actionable gaps **4,557 -> 3,699** after moving macro arms to intentional
boundary accounting. The remaining top actionable non-parser rows are now Ruby regex/case-equality
operators, Rust `crate`, Ruby `then`, Rust `let_condition`, Go type-case/goto surfaces, and Swift
operator/selector tails; parser `ERROR` rows still dominate the absolute top of the worklist.

**Performance gate.** Re-running the same release commands after the tranche showed no abnormal
slowdown, so no profiling remediation was needed:

| command | before | after | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `nose stats bench/repos --top 40` | 40.73s | 16.28s | -60.0% |
| `nose gap-impact bench/repos --top 40` | 32.83s | 16.38s | -50.1% |
| `nose query bench/repos/sympy --format json` | 5.74s | 2.86s | -50.2% |
| `nose query bench/repos/raylib --format json` | 4.62s | 2.43s | -47.4% |
| `nose query bench/repos/alacritty --format json` | 0.29s | 0.17s | -41.4% |

The large wall-time improvement is not claimed as a code-speed optimization; it reflects the
same warmed workspace and release binary gate showing no regression. Treat it as a slowdown check,
not a benchmark claim.

**Review catches.** The independent review found three real regressions before closeout: compound
Swift `if case .known = kind, ready` initially compared the wrong subject, Go `iota` was not
threaded into conversions/calls, and Ruby `begin ... end while` was initially modeled as a
pre-test loop. All three were fixed with targeted tests before the final full run.

## DC. Gap-impact ranking and Rust nested constructor patterns (2026-06-20)

After §DB, raw counts alone were no longer a good worklist: parser `ERROR` and protocol boundaries
were large, while smaller surfaces could still affect many clone units. A hidden research command,
`nose gap-impact`, now ranks non-boundary Raw surfaces by affected files, affected detection units,
unit node/line mass, repository breadth, and parser-error status. The score is not a product
contract; it is a triage heuristic for choosing the next lowering experiment from the checked-out
corpus.

**Baseline impact ranking.** Running `cargo run -q -p nose-cli -- gap-impact bench/repos --top 80`
on the §DB state produced this top list after excluding parser `ERROR` as an implementation target:

| rank | surface | raw | files | units | unit lines | score |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | Rust `tuple_struct_pattern` | 3,448 | 670 | 1,184 | 66,220 | 77,256.3 |
| 2 | Rust `macro_rule_body` | 858 | 200 | 858 | 9,765 | 45,661.8 |
| 3 | Ruby `binary` | 765 | 319 | 513 | 14,878 | 29,754.0 |
| 4 | Swift `case` | 660 | 199 | 490 | 14,703 | 26,122.7 |

The Rust `tuple_struct_pattern` lead was not just frequent; it was broad. It affected 670 files and
1,184 units, mostly in `nushell`, `meilisearch`, `regex`, `tokio`, and `clap`. A sample from
`alacritty` showed the missed path clearly: top-level `Some(x)` patterns were already handled, but
nested constructor patterns inside tuple patterns, such as `(ClipboardType::Selection,
Some(provider))`, fell through to `Raw("tuple_struct_pattern")`.

**Fix shipped.** Rust pattern lowering now routes nested constructor, struct, field, wildcard,
captured, and or-pattern surfaces through exact-closed Rust pattern `Seq` tags when they appear in
expression-position pattern trees. This preserves Rust-specific pattern structure without pretending
that destructuring patterns are ordinary runtime values.

**Measured result.** Re-running full coverage after the fix:

```text
files: 67407   IL nodes: 46051702   Raw nodes: 193349 (0.420%)
= 77207 lowering-gap + 116142 protocol-boundary
```

Compared with the §DB baseline, total Raw drops **199,028 -> 193,349** and lowering-gap Raw drops
**82,886 -> 77,207** (-5,679). Rust's language gap drops **10,236 -> 4,557** (-5,679). The
post-fix `gap-impact` top non-parser candidate is now Rust `macro_rule_body` (858 Raw, 200 files,
858 units); `tuple_struct_pattern` is no longer in the top list.

**Regression coverage.** A focused Rust fixture covers the real missed shape:

```rust
match (kind, selection) {
    (Kind::Selection, Some(provider)) => provider,
    _ => 0,
}
```

The guardrails run for this pass were:

cargo run -q -p nose-cli -- gap-impact bench/repos --top 20
