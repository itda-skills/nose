# nose — experiment log

A **curated** record of what we tried and what we learned — distilled to the durable
findings, the shipped techniques, and the dead ends worth not re-walking. The full
blow-by-blow (every intermediate baseline and rejected parameter sweep) lives in git
history; this page keeps the lessons. Sections are lettered chronologically (A…BF);
other docs and code comments cite them as `§<letter>`, so the letters are stable anchors.
The methodology and headline numbers are summarized in [benchmark](benchmark.md); the passes
these experiments shaped are in [normalization](normalization.md) and
[architecture](architecture.md).

The current user-facing `nose scan` command has three channels (`syntax`, `semantic`,
`near`), described in [usage](usage.md); all share one lower → normalize → feature
pipeline, with exact semantic matches coming from the value graph.

## Measurement methodology

The early sections (A–T) measured against a 327-pair audited gold set
(`semantic_duplicates.v2`) with a **dev / held-out** repo split, line-span-IoU partial
credit, max-weight bipartite matching, repo-macro F1, and a hard-negative FP-rate, at a
**±0.019 macro-F1 noise floor** — deltas below it are not accepted. Reproduce with
`nose detect … --dump` then `nose eval` / `nose ceiling`. The target later moved twice
(§G to a strict Type-4 set, §W/§AU to the v5 refactoring-family labelset) as the goal
sharpened from "behavioral equivalence" to "refactoring-worthiness"; each move is noted
where it happens. Reference points at the start: a prior token-based baseline scored
~0.034/0.028 dev/held-out macro-F1; nose at that time scored 0.040/0.038.

---

## A. Adopted (in the main pipeline)

The shipped core, each validated by an equivalence fixture in `tests/equivalence.rs`:
tree-sitter frontends → one IL; coverage hardening (raw-node ratio 7.37% → <0.01%);
alpha-renaming; loop unification; idiom canonicalization; higher-order-function
unification; template ↔ concat; dataflow copy/expr propagation; the hash-consed value
graph (GVN) as the behavioral substrate; algebraic canonicalization (assoc/comm flatten,
De Morgan); control-flow normalization; LSH candidate generation at **k=128, b=32**.

### A2 — Determinism (symbol-content hashing)

Detection was nondeterministic (5099/5051/5066 predictions across identical runs) because
`ThreadedRodeo` assigns symbol ids in thread-race order. Fixed by hashing each symbol's
**string content** (`symbol_hash`, FNV-1a) rather than its interner id, so the
fingerprint is independent of arena order. Output is now byte-identical across runs,
thread counts, and machines.

## B. Measured on the gold set — what didn't move

LSH k=128/b=32 was the one adoption (candidate-reach 27% → 30%). Rejected or made
opt-in because they were within the noise floor or hurt precision: `b=64` (10.7M-pair
blowup), threshold lowering (F1 collapse), an atom-overlap scoring term (HN-FP up), DCE
(`--dce`, within noise), algebraic identity folding (byte-identical ⇒ zero effect), and a
coarse bag-of-operations channel (6× candidates, flat). Sub-function **blocks** were
opt-in here and judged FP-prone; that verdict was later overturned (§M) once the target
was fixed.

## C. Rejected idea *families* (the durable dead ends)

Three families that repeatedly fail, so don't rebuild them: (1) **threshold/parameter
tuning** — trades recall for precision on a shallow curve and collapses precision past a
point; (2) **coarse bag-of-operations features** — make divergent clones *surfaceable*
but not *separable*, so FP rises ≥1:1 with recall; (3) **cleanup normalization** (DCE,
algebraic identity folding) — real clones never differ this way, so **equality-saturation
/ an e-graph is not worth building** for cleanup (re-confirmed empirically in §BB).

## D. The recall funnel

Recall is lost in stages: gold → unit-extractable → candidate-reachable → scored. Early
on ~56% was lost at unit extraction and ~17% at candidate generation. The framing is
durable even as the numbers shift: the residual frontier is genuine algorithmic/structural
divergence (the undecidable Type-4 core), not a tuning problem.

## E. Cross-disciplinary candidate pipeline

A branch-per-idea protocol (clear the ±0.019 floor without a precision regression, else
drop) over ~20 ideas harvested from other fields (WL kernels, Smith-Waterman, NetSimile,
graph embeddings, ECFP/Morgan fingerprints, PDG slicing, Shazam hashing, BM25). A
nine-field sweep returned **1 merge / 8 drops**. The one win: **RANSAC consensus-offset
alignment** replacing the LCS scorer (held-out 0.0378 → 0.0489, HN-FP 0.103 → 0.077,
simpler and faster). Two lessons: candidate-widening is a dead family (recall is gated by
*scoring*, not generation), and **alignment selectivity is the lever** (selective RANSAC
helps, lenient DTW hurts).

## F. Non-exhaustive gold — LLM-as-judge pooling

A sparse gold set makes naive precision (~1%) meaningless. Fixed with pooling + a
calibrated LLM-judge oracle. The decisive finding: a **broad** "duplicate" definition
flags 95% of hard-negatives (ill-posed, non-separable), while a **strict** behavioral
Type-4 definition is crisp and separable but only ~20% of gold v2 meets it. Out-of-gold
real precision was ~6% (recall-corrected ~30%), not the naive 1%.

## G. Type-4-PURE benchmark — a benchmark-overturning finding

Strict-judging the full pool showed gold v2's `production_type4` label is **~95%
mislabeled** for behavioral Type-4: the pairs are same-skeleton/different-behavior siblings
a good detector *should reject* (`max >` vs `min <`, `parseFloat` vs `parseInt`). This
explains why nearly every prior experiment read "within-noise" — they optimized toward a
non-clone-laden target. **`typed4.v1` (65 strict positives), not gold v2, became the
target.**

## H. Judge reliability — a 3-persona panel, validated both ways

A prover/refuter/neutral panel (majority consensus) scored **0% false positives** across
all personas on 160 pairs, and the mislabel finding held (0% consensus on disputed
gold-type4). Judge *recall* was then validated on 18 hand-authored provably-equivalent
pairs → **100% consensus recall** (the two dissents were correct edge-case catches: NaN
identity, empty-array throw). Validated on both axes, the judge is a trustworthy oracle, so
`typed4.v1` and the §G overturn rest on solid ground. A detector floor-test (forced below
the size gate) showed a **tiny-function blind spot** — 13% recall, 60% cross-family false
merges — which is why `min_tokens=24` excludes that regime.

## J. Validated re-baseline + measurement stack

Rebuilt eval on the correct target with pool-aware precision and bootstrap CIs (`analyze.py`,
`synth.py`, one-command `bench.py`). Canonical baseline: type4 recall 0.589, pool-precision
0.059, AUC-PR 0.23, HN-FP 0.077. Three roadmap findings: the gap is **precision, not recall**
(AUC-PR 0.23 ≫ raw 0.06 ⇒ ranking is the top lever); nose was then a structural Type-2/3
matcher, not yet Type-4 (~6% transformation recall); normalization passes sat at noise on the
validated target.

## K. Semantic convergence + precision

The real Type-4 gap in production code is **async ↔ sync twins**, not loop ↔ reduce (which
barely occurs in real code). Adopted: async→sync name canonicalization (`__aexit__` →
`__exit__`) and small-int literal retention (`-2..=2` kept as value-keyed `LitInt`, since
`0` ≠ `1` is behavior). Rejected: a semantic floor `score = max(blend, vj)` — catastrophic,
predictions 3578 → 66,665. **Lesson: value-graph multiset-Jaccard is not precise enough as a
standalone acceptance criterion** (`vj ≥ 0.70` collides low-entropy small functions); it needs
precise semantic-key matching, not fuzzy similarity + a floor.

## L. Recall is extraction-bound — arrow-function units

Of 25 missed pairs, **19 were blocked at extraction**: the frontend only tagged
`function_declaration`/`method_definition`, so modern JS/TS `export const f = (…) => {…}`
lowered to an inline Lambda and never became a unit. Fix: a `const f = arrow/function-expr`
becomes a named `Func` unit (`lower_func_value`); inline callbacks stay Lambda. AUC-PR
0.263 → 0.337, precision held.

## M. Sub-unit (block) extraction — default ON

Flipped `--blocks` from opt-in (the §B "FP-prone" verdict predated the validated target) to
**default on**: every honest metric improved (pool-precision 0.064 → 0.106, AUC-PR 0.337 →
0.419, recall up, HN-FP flat). Real sub-function clones are small (24–40 tokens), so blocks
share the function size gate rather than a stricter one.

## N. IDF re-ranking rejected (threshold conclusion superseded by §O)

IDF-weighted multiset Jaccard was rejected (AUC-PR flat; the apparent HN-FP drop was just a
stricter operating point). This section also concluded "threshold is a weak lever, precision
tops ~0.16" — **that conclusion is a pool-precision artifact, overturned by §O.** The
IDF rejection stands.

## O. Unbiased precision benchmark — overturns §N

Replaced the biased overlap-weighted pool-precision with a **stratified-random sample by
score band, judge-labeled, population-reweighted** (`precision_sample.v1.json`). Score is in
fact strongly discriminative — §N was an artifact. **Unbiased overall precision = 17.9%**
(pop-reweighted, vs the pool's misleading 10.6%), and the precision-vs-threshold curve is the
load-bearing result:

| operating point | precision | predictions |
|---|---|---|
| ≥ 0.70 | 17.9% | 10,373 |
| ≥ 0.86 | 33% | 5,618 |
| ≥ 0.94 | 40% | 4,549 |

The bottom two bands (0.70–0.86, ~4,755 preds) are ~0% precision — pure noise the 0.70
default admits. **Do not fold the stratified labels back into the pool** (tested: it corrupts
pool-precision 0.106 → 0.060). Lessons: pool-precision is a flawed estimator; the threshold
*is* a strong precision lever (a product decision), not the weak one §N reported.

## P. Iteration loop toward world-class

A goal-driven loop (objective: recall@0.86 up, HN-FP=0 held, no prediction explosion). Net
result: **unbiased precision ~6% → 78% at recall 0.53, HN-FP 0, AUC 0.95.** The wins were
value-content gates, not threshold tuning. Confirmed dead-ends (cut here, recorded once): LSH
param sweeps (P1), callback-arrow extraction (P2), literal-weighted Jaccard (P6), a dual
candidate channel (P9) — all left recall flat because the bottleneck is *matching hard
cross-structure pairs*, not candidate generation. The operating point ≥0.86 was re-confirmed
as the balanced optimum (P10). The shipped sub-points:

- **P3 — string-literal value retention.** The dominant high-score FP was "same structure,
  different string constant" (locale tables, HTTP methods). Retain the string-content hash
  (`Payload::LitStr`) in value-graph keys while the structural tag stays abstract `Str`.
  pool-precision 0.154 → 0.316, AUC-PR 0.328 → 0.759.
- **P4 — literal values in the structural tag (rejected, durable lesson).** Folding values
  into the *shape* tag raised precision but broke known-equivalence fixtures and cost true
  clones. **Literal values belong only in the value graph (soft), never the structural IL —
  the IL's job is to converge equivalent forms.**
- **P5 — score-weight search.** Swept the `(vj, sj, ransac)` simplex at threshold 0.86.
  **Best weights = (0.5, 0.3, 0.2)** — RANSAC down-weighted from 0.5 to 0.2, because it
  rewards token-order agreement but is blind to literal values (locale tables share token
  sequences). Unbiased precision 38.1% → 57.0%.
- **P7 — data-table literal gate.** **A unit whose value-graph is ≥20% literal `Const` nodes
  is a "data table"; such a pair is capped by its literal Jaccard.** Plumbing:
  `value_fingerprint_lits` exposes the literal multiset, `UnitFeat.lits`, threshold env
  `NOSE_DH` (swept: **0.20 is the knee** — 0.15 starts costing recall). Removes 218 verified
  locale-table FPs at zero recall cost.
- **P8 — class-level attribute values in the value graph.** Class units stored data as
  class-level attributes that `process_stmt` put in `env` but never pushed to a sink, so the
  value graph saw class data as empty. Fix: for non-`Func` (class) units, expose final `env`
  values as effect sinks. Unbiased precision 57% → 75.3% (the biggest single gain).
- **P11 — return-signature gate.** The ≥0.94 residual FPs were one-element diffs (`__lt__` vs
  `__gt__` — identical body, different operator) diluted in the multiset. **Cap a pair's score
  by `ret_base + (1 - ret_base)·return_jaccard` when both units return values.** Plumbing:
  `value_fingerprint_lits` (3rd return), `UnitFeat.returns`, env `NOSE_RET` (**0.80 is the
  knee**). Removes 32 verified FPs, precision 75.3% → 78.1%.

## Q. Goal reframe — refactoring-candidate discovery

The strict behavioral judge (§H–P) was the wrong oracle for the *actual* goal: surfacing code
worth a human's refactoring review, where a small FP rate is fine. Under a
refactoring-worthiness rubric, the §P precision gates were *deleting good candidates*. This
split the tool into two operating points — a strict behavioral path (gates on, 0.86) and a
candidate/refactoring path (gates off, **0.70 operating point**) — the seed of today's
`semantic` vs `near` channels. A dual candidate channel was re-tested here and rejected again
(pairs explode 4×, recall flat): candidate generation is architecturally dead for recall.

## R. Performance — frontend parser pool

The frontend (discover + parse + lower) dominates a scan (~88ms warm vs ~13ms pipeline).
**Adopted: a thread-local parser pool** — cache one `tree_sitter::Parser` per grammar per
rayon worker (`lower::parse`); ~1.8× (date-fns 88 → 48ms), byte-identical. (A `SmallVec`
child-list was a noise-level null result — parsing dominates, not allocation.)

## S. Cross-language convergence audit (bug hunt via equivalence testing)

Writing the same algorithm in each language and asserting the units converge to one IL hash
surfaced lowering bugs no single-language test catches. **The durable principle: per-language
coverage (Raw% ≈ 0) does not imply correct convergence — a construct can lower cleanly yet to
the *wrong shape*; one-algorithm-×-N-languages → one-hash convergence tests are the
discriminating check.** Bugs fixed: Rust `*x` deref wrongly became `UnOp(Neg)` (any non-`!`
unary treated as negation); Python f-strings / Ruby interpolation dropped the interpolated
expr (now folded into a `Str`+`Add` chain like `lower_template`); and branch-orientation
produced non-canonical comparisons — `invert_comparison` now returns the canonical operator
plus an operand-swap flag (`Lt`→`Le`+swap). Corpus coverage after fixes: 99.99%.

## T. Performance — parallelize every stage (~14k → ~19.5k files/sec)

parse+lower already scaled 11.6× across cores (CPU-bound on tree-sitter); the wins were in the
remaining stages. **T1 — parallel file discovery** via `ignore`'s parallel walker (33 → 20ms);
crucially, **paths are sorted by name, so a file's `FileId` is deterministic across machines**.
**T2 — sort-based parallel LSH** (3.6×): emit `(band-hash, unit)` entries → `par_sort_unstable`
→ pairs per equal-hash run; byte-identical. **T3 — fuse normalize+extract** into one
`flat_map_iter`, halving peak IL working set. (Pre-sizing the IL arena was slightly slower;
reverted.)

## U. Refactor-worthiness ranking — test-awareness + type-def discount

For the refactoring goal the metric is top-family precision, not Type-4 recall. The dominant
real noise is test duplication and value-poor type definitions. A ranking-time discount (scan
path only; `rank_families`, gold path untouched): each family is tagged `scope = prod | test |
mixed`, and **all-`Class` families with mean `sem < 12` are ×0.25**. Disable with
`NOSE_NO_REFACTOR_DISCOUNT=1`. **Mixed test↔prod is *not* discounted** — logic that lives in
both a test and production is a real smell.

The all-`test` ×0.2 discount this section originally added was **reverted in §U.1**:
duplication in tests is a genuine smell, and suppressing it works against being a copy-paste
recall superset (79% of jscpd-weak findings are in test code). The `scope` tag survives as
reported *context* with no ranking effect; the value-poor type-def discount stays.

## V. jscpd-weak superset — the contiguous channel

Expanding the corpus to 31 repos across all 8 languages exposed that nose was far from a
jscpd-weak superset (all-pairs coverage 18.2%): **jscpd matches arbitrary contiguous token
runs, nose matched unit-bounded families.** Closing the gap needed a second channel.
**V.2 — the contiguous copy-paste channel** (`contiguous.rs`): a Rabin-Karp scan over each
file's **raw-IL** token stream finding maximal duplicated runs regardless of unit boundaries —
the Type-1/2 floor. Built from raw IL because alpha-renaming is function-scoped; honours
`// nose-ignore`. Coverage 18.2% → 78.1%. This is today's `syntax` channel.

## W. Refactoring-family labelset + the product metric

Built the ground-truth eval the goal needs (`bench/labels/`): an unbiased candidate pool
(nose-structural ∪ jscpd-weak) labeled `worthy`/not by a 3-persona LLM panel, dev/held-out
split. Result: worthy-**recall 97%**, **precision@10 57%** — recall is excellent, **ranking
precision is the lever**. ~43% of the top-10 are not-worthy (parallel-by-design, locale/i18n
maps, generated/vendored). This is the measurement foundation the §U/§V false starts lacked.

## X. Ranking precision — labelset-driven

Using the §W labelset as ground truth, **every candidate ranking signal was validated before
shipping — and the labelset rejected most of them, exactly as intended.** Only the
generated/vendored-path discount (×0.1, scan-only) shipped: precision@10 61% → 63%, recall
held at 97%. Rejected: a literal-dominance (`data_ratio`) down-weight (the opposite of the
hypothesis — high `data_ratio` is *more* worthy) and a candidate-mode data-table gate. The
dominant remaining polluters are zod-style locale/version parallel-data variants, structurally
identical to worthy duplication under every cheap signal.

## Y. Anti-unification re-rank — the reframe (metric gain didn't replicate)

The durable reframe: rank by how clean the shared *abstraction* is, not raw duplication
volume — anti-unify two members into a template with `struct_holes`/`value_holes`, where
`value_holes` catch the zod-locale polluter (the holes *are* the content, not a parameter).
The reframe ships later as `--show proposal` (§AF) and informs `extractability` (§AZ). The
simulated **+8pp** precision gain, however, was validated only on the small v1 set and **did
not replicate** on larger labelsets (next sections).

## Z–AD. The re-rank metric was noise; precision power is repo-bound

A multi-section arc (per-language eval, bootstrap CIs, labelsets v2–v4 up to 4,615 families)
that **dissolved its own narrative before anything shipped**. A per-language A/B first showed
the §Y gain was +22pp on TypeScript and −5pp on Rust; bootstrap CIs (§AB) then showed *both*
were within noise and the re-rank gain never replicated heldout (62% → 62%). Two durable
results: **do not ship the uniform re-rank** (recall-side levers are the real ones), and
**per-language precision power is bounded by #repos × 10, not #labels** (P@10 samples only the
top-10/repo), so adding labels per repo doesn't tighten per-language CIs — adding repos does.
"The eval infra paid for itself by dissolving a multi-section false narrative."

## AE. Robustness — never crash on real input

The 62-repo corpus surfaced a stack overflow (deeply-nested minified bundles) in the recursive
lowering walk on rayon's ~2MB worker stacks. Fix: 1 GiB stacks for the workers and the
command thread; regression test `deeply_nested_file_does_not_overflow` (depth 40,000). A clone
detector must never crash on real input.

## AF. Extraction-proposal output (`--show proposal`)

Shipped the §Y reframe as the user-facing proposal view: line-granularity anti-unification
of two representatives (reusing the diff-view LCS) — shared lines become the helper body,
differing runs become `⟨param N⟩`. The current CLI exposes it as `--show proposal`.
Line-level is the pragmatic granularity (sharp on function-level near-dups, coarse on
whole-file clones).

## AG. Lowering closure — every language to non-ERROR Raw ≤ 0.5%

Closed the lowering campaign (begun in §AA, the per-language Raw-gap work) to target: all 9
languages at 0.01–0.25% non-ERROR Raw, no construct > 0.3%. Two disciplines: route stray
statement kinds back through the statement path, and erase type-level nodes to `empty_block`,
not `Raw`. The remaining Raw is essentially all ERROR (tree-sitter parse failures — the
irreducible floor); further Raw fixes would be metric-gaming. `bench/lowering_gaps.py` is the
work-queue dashboard.

---

## AH. The two-axis principle — why "find similar" and "be rigorous" don't conflict

The apparent conflict between finding behaviorally-same code that *looks* different (Type-4
recall) and rejecting off-by-one / wrong-operator near-misses (rigor) is an **architecture
smell, not a goal clash.** Two conflations cause it:

1. **Two purposes under one threshold.** Refactoring/DRY wants recall and tolerates
   near-misses; behavioral-equivalence assertion wants precision and must reject an off-by-one.
   One global threshold cannot serve both.
2. **Two kinds of difference under one scalar.** A single similarity score blurs
   *representation* differences (names, order, sugar, loop form, commutative reorder — which
   Type-4 should ignore) with *behavioral* differences (`+` vs `*`, `>=` vs `>`, constants,
   control flow — which Type-4 must never ignore).

**The resolution — and it is what nose exists to do — is to separate the axes:**
representation differences are absorbed by *exact* canonicalization (alpha-rename, GVN,
commutative sort — push more variation into byte-identical post-normalization); behavioral
differences are measured *strictly* on the residual (an operator swap is a different program,
not a near-miss); and output is graded, not binary, so the consumer picks the cut. The deeper
thesis: token-set similarity was exhausted after 160 experiments, and **rigor is not in tension
with the thesis — rigor *is* the thesis. Hardening the substrate is what enables tolerance: the
more exactly representation variants collapse to identical, the farther-apart forms can safely
be called the same.** This drives work items #1 (the two-axis evaluator) and #3 (the
value-graph loop-recurrence normal form).

## AI. The two-axis evaluator + value-graph reduction normal form

Operationalizes §AH. **#1 — the instrument** (`nose features` + a convergence probe): read
fingerprints *directly*, bypassing the LSH → threshold → union-find pipeline (which confounds
"did the signal converge?" with "did the pipeline surface it?"). It measures value-Jaccard for
*equivalent* pairs (representation axis, want → 1.0) vs *near-miss negatives* (behavior axis,
want → 0.0), the margin between the two clouds, and a threshold-free **rank-separation** =
P(an equivalent pair outscores its family's negatives). The baseline was damning and
clarifying: **representation 0.25, behavior 0.57, margin −0.32, rank-sep 18% — the signal was
inverted** (near-miss bugs looked *more* similar than true Type-4 equivalents).

**#3 — the loop-recurrence normal form** fixed it: thread the recurrence (carry symbolic
prev-iteration values so reductions reach the fingerprint), canonical reductions
`Reduce(⊕, init, contrib)` whose per-element `contrib` keys the value (so sum vs product stay
distinct — behavior preserved), and indexed-`while` induction-variable detection
(`xs[i]` → `Elem(xs)`). Nine increments closed the long tail (HoF → Reduce, guarded/filtered
reductions, min/max selection, zip/`enumerate`), flipping the margin positive. Final:
**representation 0.25 → 0.73, behavior 0.57 → 0.39, margin −0.32 → +0.34, rank-sep 18% → 76%** —
inverted to strongly correct, each transformation family locked by an equivalence test.

Crucially, **§AH is now in the code, forced by a test**: sharpening behavioral precision broke a
candidate-mode test that merged a sum-loop with a product-loop, so **strict mode trusts the
value graph (behavioral); candidate/refactoring mode is structure-dominant (shape-weighted)**,
and two units sharing a skeleton but differing in a behavior-defining operator still surface for
human review. `recursion_iteration` (loop ↔ recursion) is left **explicitly out of v1 scope** as
a meaning-risking rewrite.

## AJ. Behavioral oracle — verifying the value graph is *sound*

A deterministic partial interpreter over the normalized IL (`crates/nose-normalize/src/interp.rs`)
plus a checker (`nose verify`) that groups units by value fingerprint and asserts
**fingerprint-equal ⟹ behavior-equal on every input** (a battery of input vectors per
interpretable function). It is intentionally *partial*: any unmodeled construct (opaque call,
field access, exception) makes the whole unit uninterpretable and it is excluded — never
guessed. (A genuine runtime *type error*, though, is behavior, not an unmodeled construct: e.g.
iterating a non-iterable — a scalar where the battery feeds one to a `for`-each — yields `Err`,
so a foreach-accumulator stays interpretable across the battery instead of being dropped.) It **need not match any language exactly, only be self-consistent**: a genuinely
equivalent pair agrees under any consistent semantics, so a merge the interpreter contradicts is
a real bug. This sets the asymmetry that defines the instrument: **soundness violations are
proofs (every one a real bug); completeness misses are leads (some real, some battery
artifacts).** Run on the 62-repo corpus it caught two violations a synthetic dashboard could not,
then reached SOUND (0 violations) after fixing them: **(1) path-insensitive returns** —
branch-swapped `if c {return A} else {return B}` fingerprinted identically; fix tags each
return/throw with its **path condition**. **(2) duplicate-parameter collapse** — `f(a,a)`
matched `f(data)`; fix seeds parameters by **position**, not cid.

## AK. Wiring the verified value graph into detection (the soundness payoff)

The value-graph work was *stranded*: the detector blended syntactic terms (shape + RANSAC) that
drag a true Type-4 clone below threshold no matter how well `vj` converges. **Because `nose
verify` proved identical value fingerprints ⟹ behaviorally equal (0 false merges across 15k
units), the detector trusts an exact value-fingerprint match outright and accepts it regardless
of syntax** — a one-line fast path, guarded by a minimum fingerprint size. Calibration
(`P(behavior-equal | vj)`) shows a sharp cliff that justifies exact-only:

| value-Jaccard | P(behavior-equal) |
|---|---|
| 1.0 (exact) | **100%** (347,513 pairs) |
| [0.8, 0.9) | ~75% |
| [0.5, 0.8) | ~82% |

**A verified-sound semantic signal can be trusted aggressively, and that trust is what converts
representation convergence into real detection.** The rule that follows: **the remaining
partial-`vj` Type-4 clones must be caught by *raising* their `vj` to exact (more
canonicalization), not by *lowering* the threshold to admit them.** (Synth T4 recall 0/17 →
3/17, 0 FPs; labelset P@10 59% → 62%.)

## AL. Closing the jscpd-superset recall gap (72% → 92%)

Four frontend fixes, no gaming (labelset P@10 59% → 69%, worthy-recall 97% → 99%): recurse into
C `preproc_if`; lower TS type/interface/enum decls to a structural skeleton; emit
import/`#include`/`use` block tokens (54% of misses); and lower the contiguous floor from 20/4
to 10/3 tokens/lines.

## AM. Quantifying value-add over jscpd — the oracle as judge

`bench/value_add.py` uses the §AJ oracle as an independent judge (GOLD = interpretable pairs with
identical non-trivial behavior). Baseline: jscpd recall 90.0%, nose 95.7%, **value-add 57.1%**
(12 of 21 jscpd-missed pairs recovered) at **100% behavioral precision**. The size gate is
critical — 7,391 raw pairs reduce to 211 meaningful ones (97% were trivial fixtures) at
≥5 lines / ≥24 IL tokens.

## AN. Scaling the controlled benchmark — 8 languages, the two-axis guard

Rebuilt the controlled set (742 fixtures / 671 clone pairs, 8 languages × 10 algorithms ×
base/t2/t3/t4/neg + cross-language). Negatives are single-operator behavioral near-misses
(`>` → `!=`) — the no-gaming spine. The benchmark **must report both §AH axes** (candidate vs
behavioral) and read precision off the behavioral axis. (A two-axis precision leak measured here
at 61% was a threshold-measurement bug, corrected to 25% in §AP.)

## AO. Behavioral-axis fix — the counting-loop induction misclassification

A counting accumulator `count += 1` matched the induction-variable shape, was bound to
`idx(xs)`, and never reached a `Reduce` — the whole accumulation evaporated (identical
fingerprints across `>`/`>=`). Fix: a genuine loop counter both steps by a constant **and**
governs the loop condition (intersect `induction_vars` with the condition variables). A textbook
Pareto move — lifts both precision and recall.

## AP. The threshold measurement bug — the real baseline is 25%, not 61%

The benchmark read the behavioral axis through the refactor path's `0.70` candidate default
instead of the detector's calibrated `0.86`, inflating the whole baseline. Corrected: behavioral
neg-FP 61% → 25%, T4-strict 25% → 18%. Separately, a Java `class { method }` wrapper collapsed to
a 2-atom shell (`process_stmt` had no `Func` case); fix: **a container's behavior is the
aggregate of its methods** (`build_unit` descends into each `Func`). Java FPs 20 → 7. This is the
canonical correction later sections defer to.

## AQ. The size gate was the T4 recall blocker, not the value graph

The missed T4 forms were dense one-liners (`sum(v for v in xs if v>0)`, `max(xs)`); the value
graph *does* converge them (jaccard 1.00), but they fell below the unit size gate and were never
extracted. Fix, in the spirit of §AH (**gate on *semantic* content, not surface size**): admit a
frontend-tagged function below the line/token gate when its value fingerprint is rich enough
(`value.len() >= 6`, the floor the exact-match path already requires). The largest single
increment, clean Pareto: value-add 57% → 66%, precision held.

## AR. Two idiom fixes (partial)

`functools.reduce(f, xs, init)` was misrouted through the method-HoF arm (treating the
`functools` module as the collection); special-cased to `Builtin::Reduce`. And swapped-polarity
guarded folds (`acc + v if v > 0 else acc`) gained the swapped `Phi` case. Both sound but
partial — the Python idiom long tail has diminishing returns.

## AS. Soundness bug hunt — seven false merges, each with a reproducer

An adversarial hunt for false merges (the corpus oracle reported 0, so bugs were crafted as
one-dimension near-miss pairs). **fingerprint-equal must imply behavior-equal.** Seven bugs, each
locked by a `tests/equivalence.rs` reproducer (fails before, passes after), in two families:

**Family A — loop iteration-extent dropped** (the value graph abstracted `C[i]` → `Elem(C)` as
if every loop visited all of `C`): **(1) range-start** — `range(len(a))` ≡ `range(1, len(a))`,
now only a provably-full range licenses the `Elem` rewrite; **(2) while-stride** — `i += 1` ≡
`i += 2`, only unit-stride zero-start counters are full indices; **(3) early-break** —
prefix-sum-with-`break` ≡ full sum, `break` now records its path condition as a distinct sink.

**Family B — identity/value dropped in lowering or alpha-renaming:** **(4) slice bounds
(Python)** — `a[1:]` ≡ `a[:1]`, collecting only *named* slice children dropped which slot the
bound occupied; **(5) slice/range bounds (Go, Rust)** — same collapse, plus Rust merged `1..2`
with `1..=2`; **(6) free-variable collapse** — alpha-rename gave *every* name a positional cid so
`foo(x)` ≡ `bar(x)` and `max(a,b)` ≡ `min(a,b)`; now only *bound* names are renamed, free names
keep identity (zero recall cost); **(7) boolean literal values** — `True` ≡ `False` (abstracted to
a valueless `Lit(Bool)`); added `Payload::LitBool(bool)` end-to-end.

## AT. Reconsidering the "lossy approximations" — `in` was a bug too

Auditing the §AS "deliberate lossy approximations" found an eighth rationalized bug: `in`/`is` →
`Op::Eq` was unsound — membership is non-commutative (`a in b` ≢ `b in a`) and lowering dropped
negation. Fix: a non-commutative `Op::In` (interp gained a membership arm); `not in`/`is not` keep
negation. This established the **standing three-way classification** that
[normalization](normalization.md)'s soundness constraint now states:

- **Rationalized bugs** — none known; the §AS seven and `in` are fixed.
- **Genuine limitation, not "acceptable"** — string/list concatenation via a commutative `+`
  (`s + x` ≡ `x + s`) is unsound, but a sound fix needs type/sequence inference a type-free
  cross-language tool lacks (first supplied as `types.rs`, later moved to `ValueDomain` /
  `ValueLaw` contracts in `nose-semantics`; §AW/§BA).
- **Legitimate fuzzy tradeoff, but mis-placed** — large-constant / float abstraction
  (`x % 7` ≡ `x % 11`) belongs on the candidate axis, not the shared value graph (it violates the
  behavioral axis's "constants must be distinct" rule). The principled fix is an axis split.

## AU. Cross-field divergence → the precision frontier → v5 settles the re-rank

Six subagents brainstorming from different fields **all converged on the same architecture —
structure-invariant *candidate generation* → behavioral *confirmation* (the oracle as generator,
not just checker).** Two concrete bets were refuted by measurement (behavioral-near-match gating;
symmetry-orbit/naming-parallelism — zero separation). The product reframe: **worthy-recall is
solved (~100%); the headroom is precision, and 62% of the precision loss is one category —
`parallel-by-design`.** Growing the gold set to v5 (105 repos, 9,461 families) settled the §Y
abstractness re-rank: **it does not generalize** (the v4 +5pp dev gain collapses to ~0 heldout, a
Rust-only effect) — **do not ship it.** The precision frontier is real and **judgment-deep**; the
remaining lever is an LLM-judge re-ranker, not another cheap feature.

## AV. The precision loss is judgment-deep all the way down

There is no cheap *sound* structural gate for the "detectable" not-worthy categories — type-def
vs extract-base, trivial vs worthy-parameterize, generated — each is entangled with worthy
lookalikes of *identical shape* (e.g. httpx `get/post/put → request(VERB)` is structurally
identical to a non-worthy thin delegation). The §Y abstractness re-rank nets positive only for
Rust, and only because Rust's *base* value-rank is poor (it buries clean small helpers under
module-level matches); elsewhere it demotes worthy larger families. The genuine,
language-agnostic sub-signal is "base value-rank under-ranks small clean helpers" — which §AZ
exploits.

## AW. Core-hardening — sound foundation + machine-checked canons + type inference

A deliberate pivot from the judgment-deep product metric toward a *sound and capable core*, with
**the verifier as the safety net for bold attempts: an unsound canon shows up instantly as a
false merge and gets rolled back.** **Phase 0** drove false merges 15 → 0 via five
language-general fixes (subtree-hash keying for `Raw` nodes, dead-code-after-unconditional-return
drop, last-write-wins per field, `Err` propagation through conditions, excluding empty
fingerprints from `verify`). **Phase 1** moved the soundness contract from empirical ("0 merges on
N repos") to **proven in Lean 4** (`normalize.value_graph.algebra`,
`normalize.control_flow.guard_returns`, `normalize.value_graph.functor`:
AC-flatten+sort denotation-preserving, `a − b → a + (−b)`, guard-clause ≡ if-else, map-fusion
functor law). Bold canons were verifier-gated: untyped `-(-x) → x` / `x & x → x` were **refuted
(caught 17 false merges** — they drop the operator's type-error behavior), then re-enabled
*soundly* via purpose-fit type inference (`types.rs` at the time, now `ValueDomain` /
`ValueLaw` contracts in `nose-semantics`; coarse Num/Bool/Str/List/Unknown):
**`+` commutes unless an operand is proven string/list; Unknown still commutes, so the common
numeric case is unaffected.** The standing principle: **each canon is justified by correctness +
soundness + a proof, not by moving a noisy completeness number** (which is insensitive to any one
correct canon).

## AX. The independent oracle — unmasking the commutativity-of-non-commutative-ops bug class

§AW's verifier had a hole: it interpreted the *same fully-normalized IL it fingerprinted*, so any
behavior-changing canon **masked itself** (`a or b` and `b or a` both sorted to one IL, looked
identical). **A differential oracle must not share its subject's canonicalization, or it certifies
the very rewrites it should police.** The fix: it now interprets the **pre-canonicalization core
IL (`desugar` + `alpha` only, via `NormalizeOptions.oracle`), matched to each fully-normalized
unit by source span, while still fingerprinting the full normalize.** This exposed a whole bug
class — treating non-commutative operators as commutative — each a real latent false merge fixed at
root: value-`and`/`or` short-circuit (commutativity type-gated on Bool, else a positional `Phi`),
`!!x → x` (`!!5` = true ≠ 5), `not(Err) → Bool(true)` must propagate, `x*1 → x` / `x+0 → x`
unsound for non-numeric, and string/list `+` operand sort (concat is non-commutative). A second,
**pair-free canon-preservation check** (interpret each unit on core IL *and* full IL, require equal
behavior) flagged 20 concat sites with no colliding twin needed. Result: `verify` = 0 false merges
under the independent oracle, canon-preservation = 0 behavior-changing units. (The completeness
ratio dip 62% → ~59% is honest oracle fidelity — the denominator grew — not a regression.)

## AY. Re-sweeping the log with the better system (types + v5 + oracle)

Re-tried old blockers the hardened system might lift. Three IL adoptions: existence/universal loop
forms (`for … return True/False` ≡ `any`/`all`), collection-building loops ≡
comprehensions/`.map`/`.collect` (cross-language, +8 completeness), and float-constant distinction
(retained source-text hash — floats had collapsed to one token, a latent false merge the float-less
oracle couldn't see). One rejection: doubling `x*2 ≡ x+x` (made `verify` ~10× slower for a marginal
idiom). Critically, all three adoptions *strengthened* the behavioral fingerprint yet v5 P@10 did
not move — **empirically confirming the precision ceiling is judgment-deep, not
semantic-signal-limited.**

## AZ. Extractability as the default ranking — the re-rank that *does* generalize

§AU/§AV settled that a uniform abstractness re-rank does not generalize. The **`extractability`
ranking — now the default sort for `nose scan`** — is not that re-rank: instead of a bare
abstractness multiplier it scores *invariant (shared) source lines × copies × spread* with three
correctives the prototype lacked — **tightness** (shared/total, so a 22/384 dispatch skeleton can't
outrank a 15/15 pair), a **parameter penalty** (a 30-hole "helper" is scaffolding), and an **IDF
idiom-gate** (pervasive lines like `if err != nil {` contribute ~0) — plus zero-invariant-line
families score 0 (the structural-only `sim 1.00` pathology) and a type-def/generated discount;
cross-language families fall back to the structural estimate. In the historical §AZ slice it was
the first ranking change to move the held-out number in the right direction (held-out +6pp,
dev flat, no recall cost, reordering only). The durable lesson is that a re-rank built from
what actually extracts (tight, few-param, non-idiom shared lines) generalized where one built
from raw structural abstractness did not. For current reproducible P@10/recall numbers, use
[benchmark](benchmark.md); `--sort value` is retained for raw-volume triage, and detection is
unchanged (same families, only order and the `N/M shared · Pp` cell differ).

## BA. Exact-Type-4 convergence push — stronger types, Lean-backed algebra, filter fusion

A focused pass to raise *exact* Type-4 convergence while holding full-corpus `verify` = 0 and
backing each algebraic law with a Lean proof. **Adopted** (93 equivalence tests green, SOUND):
fixpoint param-type inference over subexpression result types (`types.rs` at the time, now
`ValueDomain` / `ValueLaw` contracts in `nose-semantics`, licensing the gated numeric rewrites);
distribution/factoring `a*c + b*c → (a+b)*c` gated on proven Num
(`NoseAlgebra.distrib_sound`); full **AC canonicalization in the value graph itself** (`mk`
flattens+sorts `+ * & | ^`, so *synthesized* nodes re-canonicalize, not only the IL algebra pass);
**filter fusion** representing `filter(p, c)` as a filtered identity-map `Hof(Map, [Elem c, p])` so
nested filters fuse to `p ∧ q` (`NoseFunctor.filter_fusion` — the deferred "make Filter carry its
element"; an earlier peel-to-bare-`Filter` caused 2 false merges, this does not); reduce-lambda
min/max selection; count-of-filter; method-form iterator reductions
(`xs.iter().filter(p).sum()` ≡ Python `sum(… if p)`); and **dict-builder ≡ dict-comprehension**,
sound by *representation* — `DictEntry` is a distinct node from a tuple `Seq` (guarded by
`assert_ne!`), since dicts are not oracle-modeled. **Rejected as cross-language unsound:** doubling
`x*2 ≡ x+x` (canonical form depends on whether operands prove Num) and negative-index
`s[-1] ≡ s[len(s)-1]` (last-element in Python/Ruby, undefined in JS) — both *genuine
language-semantic divergences, not representation gaps.* Verdict: **full-corpus `verify` stays 0
false merges across 28,113 interpretable units, and the v5 refactoring-precision number is
unchanged — reconfirming §AY that behavioral-convergence gains don't move the judgment-deep
number while costing nothing there. The win is squarely on the exact-Type-4 axis.** The Lean core
gained the `normalize.value_graph.compare` obligation; a `formal` CI job regression-checks all
theorems.

## BB. Confluence audit + lattice comparison canon (rules, not a new engine)

Probed the "replace ordered passes with an e-graph / equality saturation" thesis by first
*measuring* whether the recursive `mk` already behaves as a fixpoint: seven phase-ordering-stressing
equivalences → **6/7 already converge** (including multi-step `a*c + b*c + d*c → (a+b+d)*c`). This
reproduces §C/§AW by construction: **the lever is new sound rules, not a better rule-application
engine** — an e-graph would still need each rule declared, and the fixpoint it buys is largely
already present. The one gap was the lattice identity `(x ≤ y) ∧ (x ≠ y) ≡ x < y`; adding just that
one rule (`value_graph.rs lattice_le_ne_to_lt` + dual) *composes through the `mk` fixpoint* to close
the full cross-language `not(a > b or a == b) ≡ a < b`. Sound on any total order
(`normalize.value_graph.compare`).

## BC–BF. Behavioral-equivalence gate and widening the oracle

A four-part thread (a research subcommand only — not a detection channel) that probed using the
interpreter oracle as an in-loop *acceptance gate*, then chased the lead it surfaced.

- **BC — the gate has no headroom.** On a 10k synthetic corpus, exact fingerprint already merges
  100% of interpretable positives, so behavioral acceptance recovers nothing and only adds false
  merges. A wider input battery cut false merges 7.9% → 5.5% but never to zero — reaffirming the §AK
  cliff that *only exact equality is 100% sound.* The actionable finding inverts the hypothesis:
  **the interpreter oracle, not the fingerprint, is now the weaker model** (behavioral recall 64.9%
  vs the fingerprint's 100%, because map/option/string predicates fall outside the interpreter's
  faithful Int/Bool/Str/List domain).
- **BD — the lead was mis-aimed.** Classifying 1,056 synthetic `verify` "violations": ≈98% are
  numeric reductions in C aligned-array form `f(int *xs, int n)` merged by the "`n` is exact length"
  contract while the oracle feeds a *free* `n` — i.e. **the C pointer-length contract, not maps**
  (maps are <2%). Modeling `GetOrDefault` was inert because `verify` interprets the pre-canon core
  IL (§AX) where a map-default is still raw indexing; reverted.
- **BE — the pointer-length contract, executed.** The oracle now binds `n = len(array)` per battery
  row where `full_pointer_length_contract` fires (the same contract the value graph used to merge).
  Synthetic violations **1,056 → 508 (−52%, strictly monotone)**; real-code `verify` stays SOUND.
- **BF — rebase verdict (what survived a refactored `main`).** A later `main` removed a family of
  interpreter builtins (`IsEmpty`/`Contains`/`GetOrDefault`/…) and changed some lowerings (Java
  `Math.min(a,b)` now an opaque call, not `Builtin::Min`). **Obsoleted and dropped:** map-read and
  nullish/option modeling (depended on the deleted builtins) and two-arg scalar `min`/`max` (now
  inert). **Survived / re-validated:** the §BB lattice canon (`convergence_probe5` 10/10) and the
  §BE pointer-length contract (re-measured 800 → 252). The durable lesson: **a soundness-oracle
  improvement is durable only insofar as the IL shape it keys on is durable** — canons keyed on
  stable value-graph structure survived; builtin-keyed modeling did not.

## BG. Hazard ranking — divergent-edit calibration from mined history

A *severity* ranking ([hazard-ranking](hazard-ranking.md)) distinct from extractability:
rank families by how likely they are to be edited inconsistently and cause a bug. The
literature ([hazard-benchmark](hazard-benchmark.md)) gave the signals and directions but
not the weights, so we mined ground truth before implementing.

- **BG-data.** Used nose as a cross-revision linker (`eval/hazard/`): monthly snapshots
  of **12 repos across 8 languages** (django, pandas, kafka[Java], terraform, hugo, tokio,
  ripgrep, redis, vue-core, express; thrift[X], grpc[X]), labeling each family-interval by
  Kim's Inconsistent-Change from `git diff` over member spans; **G2** = a G1 whose changed
  sibling's *function* was modified by a bug-fix commit that did not propagate (git
  `-L:funcname`). **462,569 events; 4,639 divergent edits (G1), 181 "G2" over 15,199
  families.** Function-level attribution landed the G2 *rate* in the literature's 1–3%
  range — **but an LLM-judge audit of all 181 found the G2 label only ~11% precise**
  (48 message false-matches, 47 intentional divergences, 41 not-clones). So **G2 is
  retracted as a gold label**; validation rests on the clean, directly-observed **G1**.
- **BG-finding — the pre-data formula was mis-specified.** Leave-one-repo-out logistic
  weights (stable): `mean_lines` **+0.43** (top), `modules` **+0.28**, `mean_sem`
  **−0.27 (anti)**, `invisibility` **+0.14**, `members` +0.13, `params` +0.04 (noise — sign
  flipped from −0.06 at 7 repos). The first-draft design led with `mean_sem` as the
  *primary* multiplier — but semantic-fingerprint size is **anti-predictive** for
  divergent-edit ranking (typical divergences are in smaller families; the mean is a
  large-tail artifact). Source-**line** span is the real magnitude signal.
- **BG-formula.** `hazard = mean_lines × spread(files,modules,languages) × invisibility ×
  scope_weight` — leave-one-repo-out AUC **G1 0.644** vs **0.609** size-led draft, 0.611
  value-baseline, ~0.49 random. **Implemented as opt-in `--sort hazard`**;
  `extractability` stays the default fixability axis. The param-dampening term tested
  earlier was dropped (sign-unstable weight).
  `invisibility` (1−tightness) is a modest, stable general signal (+0.14). **Correction:**
  a first draft claimed it was "the top signal in the cross-language stratum (0.67)" —
  but that was a repo-level mislabel (thrift+grpc tagged X). True cross-language families
  are structurally rare (37 of 15,199; arrow 0 of 928), so the cross-language-specific
  claim is retracted; invisibility holds as a general predictor.
- **BG-audit — the gold label was mostly noise.** An LLM judge reviewed all 181 G2 events
  blind (`audit_sample.py` rebuilds the two members' code + the bug-fix commit): **strict
  precision 11% (20/180)**. False sources: 48 message false-matches (the bug-fix keyword
  caught version drops, features, typo/docs/config changes), 47 intentional divergences
  (async/sync, virtual/stored, test variants that legitimately differ), 41 not-clones
  (near@0.70 grouped trivial stubs). The lesson: `rate-match ≠ precision`, and a real gold
  label needs the LLM judge *as the labeler*, not the keyword heuristic. The 20 confirmed
  positives seed a real (small) gold set.
- **BG-gold — the formula predicts propensity, not harm.** Built that real gold: an LLM
  labeled 1,390 G1 candidates blind *with the diff* into harm/should-propagate/benign,
  adversarial pass refuting weak positives (`build_candidates.py` → `gold-label-divergence`
  → `gold_eval.py`). Only 22 (strict) / 53 (lenient) are genuine should-propagate harms
  (~1.6–3.8%, reproducing the literature's 1–3%). On this gold, AUC for harmful-vs-benign
  divergence: `mean_sem` 0.61–0.64 (the *dropped* feature, best), `extractability`
  0.59–0.64, **`hazard` 0.51 (chance)**, value 0.42. **The G1 0.64 does not transfer to
  harm** — propensity ≠ harm, and static features cap ~0.6 (harm depends on whether a
  change *applies to the sibling*, a semantic question). Also: 50% of candidates are not
  real clones (near@0.70 precision). → `hazard` reverted to opt-in (default stays
  `extractability`); subsequent rounds test whether git-history, larger gold, and better
  clone precision can move the ceiling.
- **BG-gold2 — the structural+history ceiling is ~0.60 (definitive).** Did all three:
  a clone-quality gate (`shared_weight≥4`), a larger gold (2,296 labeled, 51 confirmed
  harm positives, usable CIs), and a git-history feature (blame: were the changed vs
  lagging member last touched *together*?). Harm-AUC: `-skew_days` 0.600, `mean_sem` 0.572,
  `same_commit` 0.568, `hazard` 0.531, `extractability` 0.475; a leave-one-repo-out logistic
  **combination 0.524 — no lift.** git-history is real and theory-aligned (harm happens in
  families previously maintained *together*, Barbour/Kim) but weak and only ~52%
  computable; the gate still left 46% non-clones. **Conclusion: clone-structural +
  git-history features cannot rank harm above ~0.60.** Harm is semantic — the LLM judge
  captures it (the gold's basis), metrics do not. The evidence-indicated harm ranker is a
  **bounded LLM pass over top-K structurally-surfaced candidates**, not more features.
- **BG-gold3 — cognitive complexity (#23) moved the ceiling, post-divergence.** Tested
  the parked #23 edit-surface idea on the same gold from captured member code/diff
  (`cogcomplexity.py`, `harm_model.py`). `diff_per_cog` (a small subtle change in a
  *complex* function — Krinke "critical change") harm-AUC **0.65**, the best signal yet —
  but it needs the diff, so it is a **post-divergence** signal. The best **pre-divergence**
  signal is `cog` (member cognitive complexity) at ~0.61 (≈ prior ceiling). The #23
  axis-B "edit-surface symmetry" hypothesis was wrong (asymmetry AUC 0.44); absolute
  complexity × change locality is the signal. Combos still do not lift (logistic 0.595 on
  51 positives). Revised view: harm is best assessed *after* a divergence (it is a
  property of the realized edit), where #23 reaches ~0.65 — a usable **post-divergence**
  ranker. Pre-divergence ranking still caps ~0.61.
- **BG-gold4 — does the IL obscure cognitive complexity? No (tested).** Worry: cog is a
  surface property, the IL normalizes for equivalence. `il_cog.py` computed cog from
  `nose il --normalized` (If/Loop + nesting + And/Or) vs the source-text proxy on the gold
  (95% IL parse rate): **harm-AUC 0.599 (IL) vs 0.597 (source) — identical.** Control
  structure survives `il --normalized`; only the deeper value-fingerprint collapse
  (loop≡comprehension, = `mean_sem`) erases it, and cog is not computed from that. Flip
  side: a fancier IL-cog will NOT beat the proxy — cog is ~0.60 regardless of
  representation. **Firmly established: the pre-divergence structural harm ceiling is
  ~0.60 across every representation and feature; only `diff_per_cog` (post-divergence,
  0.65) is above it. A strong harm ranker needs the semantic (LLM) layer.**
- **BG-durability.** Labels are git-derived (version-independent); features/families are
  nose-derived (stamped `nose_ver`). Only *detection* changes force a re-mine+re-tune;
  ranking changes (this work) do not. Refresh = `run_corpus.sh` + `tune.py` (minutes,
  cached clones); per-release steps in [hazard-release-checklist](hazard-release-checklist.md).

## BH. Scan performance — normalize proof lookup, not path exclusions

Profiling real corpora across Rust (`nose-normalize`, `nose-detect`), TypeScript
(`moonlight-server`, `moonlight-web`, `tex`), Python (`episteme2-app`), and Go
(`sah-cli`) showed that semantic/near scans were bottlenecked in the shared
`normalize+extract` path, not in JS-specific parsing or candidate scoring. Large generated
JS bundles can dominate an unscoped scan, but the product fix is not a built-in generated-path
exclusion; benchmark scoping used only the existing `--exclude`/config mechanism.

The hot path was `desugar` repeatedly re-scanning the whole IL to prove receiver-domain
facts for method/property idiom recognition. Replacing that with a shared
receiver-domain cache kept the exact same proof policy while removing repeated O(nodes)
lookups; the cache now lives behind the semantic-kernel facade rather than a normalize-local
side table. Additional behavior-preserving cleanup reserved rebuild arena capacity, avoided
per-node child `Vec` copies in common rebuild loops, reused file-local scope facts in value
fingerprinting, and skipped no-op recursion/dataflow/algebra/cfg-orientation rebuilds.

Representative output JSON was byte-equivalent to `origin/main` after canonical sorting
(`nose-normalize`, `nose-detect`, `moonlight-server`, `tex`, `sah-cli`, and
`craken-cli`; earlier matrix runs also covered `episteme2-app` and scoped
`moonlight-web`). After rebasing onto `origin/main@42545f2`, representative
`NOSE_TIME` deltas for `normalize+extract` were: `nose-normalize` semantic
1452ms→228ms (6.4x), near 1457ms→236ms (6.2x); `tex` semantic 445ms→64ms
(7.0x); `moonlight-server` semantic 48ms→27ms (1.8x); `sah-cli` semantic
12ms→9ms (1.3x). Whole-pipeline speedups are lower where parse/lower now
dominates; this moves the next performance frontier toward lower/parse and remaining
multi-pass normalization overhead rather than file selection policy.

Follow-up profiling split frontend timing into `parse+lower` and `import-resolve`
inside `NOSE_TIME`. The import pass is corpus-level, not JS-specific: sibling literal
exports are modeled through language semantics for Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java,
and Rust, while unsupported languages such as Go/C/Ruby do not build the added indexes.
Caching file top-level statements, path-derived module hashes, and binding-use facts
reduced representative `import-resolve` costs without changing output JSON: `tex`
~31–34ms→~4ms, `moonlight-server` ~21–25ms→~6ms, `nose-normalize` ~7–8ms→<1ms,
and `episteme2` ~6–7ms→~2ms; Go corpora stayed at 0ms. Two tempting follow-ups were
rejected after output checks: skipping import resolution for `syntax`-only scans changed
`moonlight-server` syntax families, and caching pure-inline registries changed one
Python near-family. Both are behavior changes, not safe speedups.

## BI. Language profile pass — file roots, not language-specific exclusions

A follow-up language-by-language semantic scan profiled Python, JavaScript, TypeScript,
Go, Rust, Java, C, Ruby, and embedded-script containers on local corpus repos. The goal
was to avoid repeating the earlier JS-specific trap: large bundles can be expensive, but
the product should not learn new built-in file/path exclusions. The safe optimization was
in discovery mechanics instead:

- direct file roots now bypass `ignore`'s directory walker when no `--exclude`/config
  excludes are active;
- directory discovery now checks `Path::extension()` before allocating a path string, so
  unsupported files do not pay string allocation just to be rejected;
- embedded `<script>` tag TypeScript detection uses case-insensitive byte search instead
  of allocating a lowercase copy of the tag;
- semantic extraction skips normalization only for a raw IL that is exactly an empty
  module, preserving top-level block extraction for files that have executable statements.

The representative before/after medians below used `NOSE_TIME=1 nose scan --mode semantic
--top 0 --format json`, five repetitions after the change, and the same corpus inputs as
the baseline run:

| language | files | baseline wall | after wall | result |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| python | 128 | 79.7ms | 79.1ms | stable |
| javascript | 5 | 110.7ms | 114.3ms | stable/noisy; generated-bundle cost remains a scoping issue |
| typescript | 263 | 133.0ms | 126.6ms | small common-path win |
| go | 54 | 53.3ms | 52.4ms | stable |
| rust | 37 | 500.7ms | 464.9ms | small common-path win; output diff was only shifted line numbers in edited Rust files |
| java | 13 | 89.0ms | 4.5ms | file-root discovery fixed the benchmark-shape overhead |
| c | 1241 | 546.7ms | 532.9ms | small common-path win |
| ruby | 1722 | 249.3ms | 220.6ms | small common-path win |
| embedded | 61 | 381.2ms | 26.8ms | file-root discovery fixed the benchmark-shape overhead |

Canonical JSON output was unchanged for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Java, C, Ruby,
and embedded. Rust matched after removing line-number fields; the only diff came from this
branch adding lines to a Rust source file included in the profiling input.

## BJ. The design.md §5 recall-ceiling probe — sub-DAG / inlining headroom, measured

[design](design.md) §5 named one decisive measurement that had never been run: *on the
gold set, how many missed worthy pairs would largest-common-pure-sub-DAG matching (and
helper inlining) recover?* §3 gates any further recall-mechanism bet on it. Context that
makes the question sharper: PR #82 already shipped a bounded v1 of **both** mechanisms
(shared heavy anchors at weight ≥ 20 / df ≤ 6 in `near` candidate mode; single-`return`
file-local pure inlining in the value graph), so the probe measures the **residual**
beyond everything reachable today.

**Method** (`bench/labels/recall_ceiling_probe.py`, artifact
`bench/labels/recall_ceiling_probe_2026_06_10.json`): for every worthy v5 label, two
scans — arm0 = the default surface (`syntax,semantic`), arm1 = the maximal current
surface (`syntax,semantic,near --min-value 0`). Labels arm1 misses are classified from
`nose features` dumps of the member files: **subdag-ceiling** if the two members'
tightest covering units share value-fingerprint multiset-intersection mass ≥ 8
(reported also at 12/20; 20 = the shipped `ANCHOR_MIN_WEIGHT`), **inline-ceiling** if
one same-file sibling unit's multiset added to either side lifts the mass over 20,
**same-unit-window** if both members map into one enclosing unit (the statement-window
shape), **no-overlapping-unit** if a member has no unit at all, else **unrecovered**.
Multiset intersection ignores connectivity and single-file `features` lacks whole-repo
import resolution, so the sub-DAG/inline classes **over-approximate** — a ceiling, not a
forecast. Caveats: the original run excluded `rxjs` for a scanner stack overflow later
fixed by #198; corpus was dir-pruned but not file-pruned because `prune_corpus.py` was
missing at the time. Follow-up #200 restored the script and checked-in prune manifest.

**Result** (4,921 worthy labels; dev / heldout):

| | dev | heldout |
|---|---:|---:|
| worthy-recall, arm0 (default) | 86.2% | 88.5% |
| worthy-recall, arm1 (maximal current) | 94.3% | 96.4% |
| arm1-missed | 161 | 74 |
| — subdag-ceiling (mass ≥ 8) | 64 | 35 |
| — inline-ceiling | 11 | 4 |
| — same-unit-window | 19 | 9 |
| — no-overlapping-unit | 29* | 13* |
| — unrecovered (shared mass ≈ 0) | 38 | 13 |

*combined with the residual `other` classes in the per-language table the script prints.

Of the 99 subdag-ceiling labels, only **31** reach the shipped anchor weight (mass ≥ 20;
median mass 14) — i.e. at the weight the product already considers extractable, the
unit-pair sub-DAG residual is **0.6%** absolute worthy-recall; even the optimistic
mass ≥ 8 ceiling is **2.0%**, and the one-step inlining ceiling is **0.3%**.

**Verdict — the §3 gate answers "no-go" for a headline mechanism bet.** The shipped #82
mechanisms plus the `near` channel already recover the bulk (630 default-surface misses
→ 235 maximal-surface misses); what remains is not a unit-pair matching gap:

- the **no-overlapping-unit** cluster is a *unit-extraction* gap with two concrete,
  nameable shapes — Ruby test-DSL blocks (`asciidoctor`, 21 labels) and Rust
  `macro_rules!` bodies (`clap` `macros.rs`, 14 labels) — frontier-evidence material
  (#36 discipline), not matcher work;
- **same-unit-window** (28) is the statement-window fragment axis the coverage taxonomy
  already tracks;
- **unrecovered** (51) shares ~zero value mass — parameterize/extract-helper judgments
  whose similarity is not in the computation at all (the §AV judgment-deep shape).

The one cheap knob left on the table: the 8–20 mass band (68 labels) would respond to a
lower anchor weight floor, but those small shared chunks are weak refactor targets and
the band is an over-approximation — worth at most a knob experiment
(`NOSE_ANCHOR_*`), not a mechanism. The honest headline for further worthy-recall is
**unit extraction coverage and the fragment axis, not more matching**.

## BK. The independent miss-mining arm — measuring in-the-wild misses (modality B)

The §BJ probe answered the *mechanism* question; this answers the *measurement* one
(#194): the v5 pool is nose ∪ jscpd, so semantic clones missed by **both** can't appear
in any recall denominator. `bench/type4/miss_mining.py` is the independent arm: per
pinned repo, LSH-band the detection minhash over all ≥ 5-line/≥ 40-token units, confirm
candidate pairs by exact value-multiset Jaccard (≥ 0.80), and keep pairs **no family on
the maximal current surface co-reports**. Output is a queue signal only (#36 two-layer
discipline): every record carries `evidence_tier: detector-suggested`, annotated with
`fp_equal`, `exact_safe`, and a source `text_similarity` ratio so the
textually-dissimilar tail (the jscpd-shaped blind spot) is sliceable. The complementary
modality A — behavior-equal fingerprint-split pairs — is the existing
`nose verify --leads`. Artifact: `bench/type4/miss_mining_2026_06_10.json`
(104 repos; original run excluded `rxjs` for the stack overflow later fixed by #198).

**Result: 593 candidates corpus-wide, and the audit says the residual is structured,
small, and mostly *not* detector-recall.**

| class | n | read |
|---|---:|---|
| fp-equal, same-file, not exact-safe | 375 | parameterized-test / scaffolding bodies, annotation-varying twins |
| fp-equal, cross-file | 78 | dominated by generated code (`etcd` protobuf `*.pb.go`) — correctly excluded from ranking by the generated-file policy |
| fp-equal, same-file, exact-safe | 44 | small proven twins, mostly test scaffolds |
| vj ∈ [0.8, 1.0), mixed | 96 | the only class with worthy-shaped finds |

Spot-audit of the non-fp-equal cross-file slice found one clearly worthy-shaped miss —
`libgdx` `Widget.pack()` ≡ `WidgetGroup.pack()` (identical method duplicated across
sibling classes; impure, vj 0.80 < the 0.90 value-accept, shapes split, so no channel
fires) — among stub/parallel-by-design neighbours (curl no-op callbacks, sympy protocol
type-defs). The deeper catch was mechanical: chasing *why* fp-equal `exact_safe` pairs
(`junit5` annotation-varying `fail(...)` methods) never surface exposed that **adding
the syntax channel can drop an exact semantic family the semantic channel reports
alone** — a channel-merge reporting bug, closed by #202. The fix drops
single-site windows after same-file coalescing before they can subsume reportable
multi-site semantic families.
That is the arm working as designed: candidates are cheap, and each audited one either
dies as scaffolding/generated (raising confidence in the policy layers) or names a
precise defect.

Honest bottom line for the in-the-wild recall question: at vj ≥ 0.8 the unreported mass
is ~600 pairs across 59k files, overwhelmingly generated/scaffolding; the worthy-shaped
tail is a handful per corpus — consistent with §BJ's "no headline recall mechanism
left" verdict. Below vj 0.8 (true different-algorithm Type-4) this arm is blind by
construction; that frontier remains unmeasured and would need a behavior- or
embedding-based candidate source — recorded as the arm's known limit, not claimed
covered.

## BL. Oracle exclusion census — the real-corpus completeness baseline, by construct

§BC measured the oracle's *behavioral recall* on a synthetic corpus (64.9%); what the
soundness campaign actually needed was the **real-corpus inventory**: how much of the
fingerprint-merge surface carries no behavioral verification at all, and *which IL
constructs* keep units out of the interpreter. `nose verify --exclusion-census`
(`crates/nose-cli/src/verify_census.rs`) records every counted function unit's oracle
outcome, fingerprint, and raw construct tags — for excluded AND interpretable
populations, deriving the discriminating constructs at analysis time instead of
hard-coding an "unsupported" list that would rot when lowerings change (the §BF
durability lesson). Run per repo (merge pairs counted within a repo, matching how scans
run) and merged by `bench/labels/merge_exclusion_census.py`; artifact
`bench/labels/oracle_exclusion_census_2026_06_10.json` (104 repos; `raylib` excluded —
verify does not finish on it in useful time, #208).

**Baseline.** 591,469 function units; **26,382 interpretable (4.5%)** — 526,660
battery-bail, 38,427 empty-fingerprint. Of 3,444,062 within-repo fingerprint-equal
pairs, **316,677 (9.2%) are oracle-verified; 3,127,385 (90.8%) carry no behavioral
check**. (Upper bound on the product surface: the census sees verify-side units, not
the detector's `exact_safe` gate, so some unverified mass can never reach the exact
channel anyway — stated limitation, not a correction we can compute here.)

**Discriminating constructs** (excl-share ≥ 98%, ≥ 1k excluded units, by unverified
mass): `call:other` — calls that are neither admitted builtins nor named/cid calls —
dominates at **481k excluded units / 1.71M unverified pairs**, followed by
`kind:Field` reads (420k / 1.30M), statement shapes riding on them (`ExprStmt`, `If`,
`UnOp`, `Throw`, `Lambda`, `Try`), and `lit:unretained:Other` — only 8.7k units but
**925k unverified pairs** (the generated-twin clusters; those units are lossy-lowered
and `exact_safe = false` product-side, so they are *low* campaign value despite the
mass).

**Campaign order this fixes:** (1) uninterpreted-function handling for opaque calls
and field reads — evaluate them as symbolic applications/projections recorded in the
ordered effect trace, rather than bailing the whole unit; structure-keyed, so it
survives lowering drift (§BF). (2) Statement coverage that rides on it (Throw/Try).
(3) Deprioritize unretained-literal units: their merges are already outside the exact
channel.

Side product (modality A for the detection campaign): the per-repo `--leads` pass
merged into `bench/labels/oracle_under_merge_leads_2026_06_10.json` — **179
behavior-equal fingerprint-split groups, 5 structurally near (vj ≥ 0.7)**, e.g.
nginx's `http` vs `stream` geo modules and sympy's `matrices/common` vs `matrixbase`
duplicates — oracle-proven missed clones, the strongest convergence leads available.

### BL.1 — uninterpreted symbolic values: the census-ordered extension, measured

The campaign's first move (the census's #1 and #2 targets at once): opaque calls and
unproven field reads now interpret as **identified symbolic values** instead of bailing
the unit. An opaque call evaluates its arguments, yields `Sym(callee-signature ⊕
argument values)`, and records itself in the ordered effect trace; field reads become
symbolic projections; every composition (bin/un/index/eager builtins/HoF/reduce/append/
nullish) keeps symbolic operands symbolic via a deep `contains_sym` guard — never
laundering unknownness into a concrete `Err` — and control flow over a `Sym` still
bails. The convention is differential: same opaque operations on equal operands in the
same order ⟹ equal traces. Because symbolic identity keys on pre-canon syntax, a
Sym-bearing disagreement goes to a new **advisory lane**, never the hard SOUND gate;
canon preservation and the completeness/leads direction stay concrete-only (a symbolic
behavior-equality is too weak a missed-clone witness).

Same sharded corpus pass (104 repos, raylib #208 excluded), before → after
(`oracle_exclusion_census_2026_06_10.json` → `…_post_symbolic_2026_06_10.json`):

| | baseline | symbolic | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| interpretable units | 26,382 (4.5%) | **173,874 (29.4%)** | ×6.6 |
| oracle-verified merge pairs | 316,677 (9.2%) | **1,077,871 (31.3%)** | ×3.4 |
| unverified merge mass | 90.8% | **68.7%** | −22.1pp |

The advisory lane surfaced **1,276** symbolic-trace disagreements to review (expected:
AC-canonicalized operand order legitimately differs pre-canon). The hard lane is *not*
clean — and that is a pre-existing finding, not a symbolic artifact: 17 repos flag
fingerprint-equal pairs with concretely different behavior (e.g. `black`'s
try/import-wrapper colliding with `return self` on a degenerate 2-node fingerprint),
reproducing identically on the pre-symbolic binary and on `origin/main` back to at
least 517ad5c. Filed as #210 (the exact channel is protected by `exact_safe`; the
`near` value-accept path is exposed). The remaining census leaders after this round:
`lit:unretained:Other` stays product-irrelevant (lossy-lowered), and the residual
battery-bail mass concentrates in branch-on-symbolic units (`kind:If` excl-share 92%) —
i.e. the next coverage unit is symbolic-condition path exploration, a much harder
step deliberately not taken at the time (control flow is never guessed). *Taken,
boundedly, in §BU (#244): both arms explored under recorded assumptions — conditioned,
not guessed — with a fail-closed site cap.*

### BL.2 — raylib verify budget: bound the oracle, don't hang it

Issue #208 exposed a verify-only performance path: `nose verify bench/repos/raylib` exceeded a
120s local timeout even though normal scanning completed. Sampling showed two costs compounding:
the oracle rebuilt file-level value-graph context for every unit, then ran the full input battery
against large C functions.

The fix mirrors detector extraction by sharing one `ValueFingerprintContext` per file and adds a
unit work cap before value fingerprinting or interpretation. A unit whose
`IL node count × battery rows > 384000` is excluded as `battery-bail`; this is a fail-closed
coverage loss, not a guessed equivalence.

Measured on 2026-06-10 against local raylib:

| command | before | after |
|---|---:|---:|
| `nose verify bench/repos/raylib` | >120s timeout | 62.8s |

The after run on top of the symbolic-oracle baseline reported 8182 total units, 1735
interpretable units, and 18 oversized `battery-bail` exclusions. It also surfaced two
pre-existing value-fingerprint false-merge leads and one
canon-preservation lead in raylib; #208 intentionally does not mask them with exclusions because
the product semantic scan did not report those targeted pairs, and the point of `verify` is to
make such soundness leads visible once the oracle is tractable.

## BM. Near on the default scan surface — price the locked +8pp recall

§BJ measured the biggest proven recall gap in today's product: the shipped but opt-in
`near` channel lifts worthy-recall by about eight points. This experiment prices the
product decision rather than assuming the answer: keep the current CLI default
(`syntax,semantic`), add unthresholded `near`, or adopt a thresholded middle.

**Method.** `bench/labels/near_default_surface_experiment.py` scans all 105 v5 repos
with four arms: default, `syntax,semantic,near`, `syntax,semantic,near:0.8`, and
`syntax,semantic,near:0.85`. P@10 uses the native `nose scan --format json` order
(`extractability`); worthy-recall is over worthy v5 labels; noise is the
`ranking.surface_counts.default` delta plus family `scope` splits from full `--top 0`
JSON. Artifact: `bench/labels/near_default_surface_2026_06_10.json`. Held-out was
not tuned; the threshold arms are reported as candidate policies, not selected by
fitting held-out.

### BM.3 — reviewer-burden proxy

| arm | default-surface families | delta | prod delta | test delta | mixed delta | review delta | hidden delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| default | 66919 | +0 | +0 | +0 | +0 | +0 | +0 |
| near | 81725 | +14806 | +10768 | +3295 | +743 | -121 | -206 |
| near:0.80 | 81523 | +14604 | +9485 | +4564 | +555 | -125 | -294 |
| near:0.85 | 79356 | +12437 | +8485 | +3437 | +515 | -158 | -463 |

**Verdict: flip the default channel mix to include unthresholded `near`, but do it as a
separate product change with release/docs migration notes.** The held-out gate does
not show a material P@10 drop; it improves from 55.5% to 58.6% while worthy-recall
jumps from 88.5% to 96.7%. The thresholded middle is not a good trade: `near:0.80`
keeps almost all the default-surface burden (+14.6k vs +14.8k) while giving back
three points of held-out recall, and `near:0.85` saves only another ~2.2k default
families while giving back more than half the recall gain.

The cost is real: unthresholded `near` adds 14,806 default-surface families across the
corpus (+22.1%), mostly production-scope (+10,768) with a large test-scope tail
(+3,295). That argues for making the flip explicit rather than silent. But
[design](design.md) §2's primary consumer is an LLM agent that wants high recall and
can filter/rerank; perfect worthiness separation in the scanner is lower leverage for
that consumer. With no held-out precision hit and a measured +8.2pp held-out
worthy-recall gain, keeping `near` opt-in would leave proven useful candidates behind
the flag that the primary consumer is least likely to remember.

### BM.4 — the flip, shipped + post-flip sanity re-run (#241, 2026-06-11)

The verdict was executed in #241: `nose scan`'s default is now
`syntax,semantic,near` (an explicit `--mode`/config `mode` still replaces it;
`nose review`'s default deliberately stays `syntax,semantic` — review feeds a
gate, and this experiment priced the scan surface only). Post-flip sanity on the
then-current binary (post-§BP/§BQ, so absolute numbers differ from the BM.1–BM.2
tables), default arm vs pinned `--mode syntax,semantic`
(`bench/labels/near_default_flip_sanity_2026_06_11.txt`):

| arm | split | P@10 | worthy-recall |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| `syntax,semantic` (old default) | dev | 59% [54–64] | 86.3% |
| default (flipped) | dev | 58% [54–64] | 95.2% |
| `syntax,semantic` (old default) | heldout | 52% [47–58] | 88.7% |
| default (flipped) | heldout | 55% [49–60] | **96.9%** |

The §BM direction reproduces exactly: held-out worthy-recall +8.2pp, held-out
P@10 +3pp (within CI), dev P@10 flat. CI/baseline migration notes are in the
CHANGELOG entry.

## BN. Ruby test-DSL blocks — turn invisible test bodies into block units

Issue #214 investigated the Ruby no-overlapping-unit misses left by §BJ. The
common failure mode was not semantic matching; it was unit extraction. Minitest and
RSpec-style tests are method calls whose block bodies are function-shaped review
units, but the Ruby frontend only kept the call/lambda structure as nested values,
so the scanner had no unit rooted at the test body.

Representative evidence before the change:

| repo | location | observed pattern |
|---|---|---|
| `asciidoctor` | `test/tables_test.rb:1560` and `:1601` | two `test '...' do` bodies with duplicated setup/assertion shape |
| `fastlane` | `spaceship/spec/client_spec.rb:147` and `:218` | repeated `describe 'retry' do` blocks with nested examples |
| `rubocop` | `spec/rubocop/cop/style/infinite_loop_spec.rb:6` and `:23` | parameterized `it "registers..." do` examples inside `%w(...).each` |

The implementation is intentionally conservative: when a Ruby call's method name is
in a test-DSL allowlist (`test`, `it`, `specify`, `example`, `describe`, `context`,
`feature`, `scenario`, shared-example/context hooks, and setup/teardown hooks), the
frontend emits the existing lambda body as a `Block` unit named from the method and
first literal label argument, for example `it:adds values`. Generic iterator blocks
such as `.each do` remain values only.

### BN.1 — recall-ceiling probe

Artifact: `bench/labels/ruby_test_dsl_recovery_2026_06_10.json`. The after probe
uses the same v5 labels as §BJ and fixes `recall_ceiling_probe.py --repos-root`
handling so worktree-local probes still classify members against the shared corpus
root.

| metric | before | after | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Ruby `no-overlapping-unit` misses | 21 | 2 | -19 |
| Ruby arm1 missed worthy labels | 55 | 41 | -14 |
| Ruby arm1 recall, dev | 343/380 (90.3%) | 352/380 (92.6%) | +2.4pp |
| Ruby arm1 recall, held-out | 232/250 (92.8%) | 237/250 (94.8%) | +2.0pp |
| Overall arm1 recall, dev | 94.3% | 94.9% | +0.6pp |
| Overall arm1 recall, held-out | 96.4% | 96.7% | +0.3pp |

The remaining two Ruby `no-overlapping-unit` misses are not test-DSL cases: one is
an extensionless Jekyll benchmark script, and one is a Sidekiq bin-script pair.
They need a different unit-coverage decision.

### BN.2 — default product metric

The default scan surface is unchanged by this fix, because the new units recover
candidate bodies for maximal/near recall without adding new default-surface families
in the measured corpus. Full `eval_by_language.py --rank extractability --top 0`
after the change matched the §BM default baseline:

| split | overall P@10 | Ruby P@10 | Ruby worthy recall |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| dev | 63% [58-68] n=353 | 84% [70-95] n=37 | 294/380 |
| held-out | 56% [50-61] n=308 | 84% [68-96] n=25 | 180/250 |

### BN.3 — Ruby extraction cost

Measured across the 15 Ruby corpus repos with `NOSE_TIME_UNIT_SUMMARY=1`:

| Ruby corpus scan metric | before | after | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| units seen | 7479 | 12283 | +4804 |
| units kept | 3377 | 5705 | +2328 |
| blocks kept | 1179 | 3338 | +2159 |
| unit extraction time | 712.9ms | 959.4ms | +246.5ms |
| candidate families | 2985 | 2985 | 0 |
| default-surface families | 2865 | 2865 | 0 |

Wall-clock scan timing in the ad hoc run was cache-order noisy, but showed no obvious
regression. The stable cost signal is extraction work: about 247ms extra over the
Ruby corpus, with no candidate-family or default-surface expansion. Verdict: keep
the allowlisted Ruby test-DSL block units. They remove the dominant Ruby unit-blind
spot from the recall-ceiling probe without harming the default product metric.

## BO. Rust `macro_rules!` arms — expose token-tree bodies without semantic overclaiming

Issue #215 tested the second named unit-extraction gap from §BJ: Rust macro bodies,
especially `clap`'s `clap_builder/src/macros.rs`, where duplicated `macro_rules!`
arms were invisible because macro definitions only contributed a shadowing marker.

The feasibility answer is mixed but useful. `tree-sitter-rust` exposes each
`macro_rules!` arm as a `macro_rule` with `left` and `right` fields, but the RHS is
a `token_tree`, not a parsed Rust statement/expression tree. The implementation
therefore extracts each RHS as a named `Block` unit (`macro_name:armN`) containing
one `Raw("macro_rule_body")` boundary plus identifier/literal atoms. That keeps the
unit matchable by syntax/near, while `exact_safe=false` prevents the semantic exact
channel from claiming runtime equivalence for token soup.

### BO.1 — recall-ceiling probe

Artifact: `bench/labels/rust_macro_rules_recovery_2026_06_10.json`.

| metric | before | after | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Rust `no-overlapping-unit` misses | 14 | 9 | -5 |
| Rust arm1 missed worthy labels | 57 | 52 | -5 |
| Rust arm1 recall, dev | 364/411 (88.6%) | 369/411 (89.8%) | +1.2pp |
| Rust arm1 recall, held-out | 245/255 (96.1%) | 245/255 (96.1%) | +0.0pp |
| Overall arm1 recall, dev | 94.9% | 95.1% | +0.2pp |
| Overall arm1 recall, held-out | 96.7% | 96.7% | +0.0pp |

The recovered labels are the `macro_rules!` arm-definition shape, led by the
`clap` `arg_impl!` arms. The remaining Rust `no-overlapping-unit` records are
not all the same shape: large single-arm macro definitions (`nushell`), macro
invocation bodies (`regex` `ffi_fn!`, `ripgrep` `rgtest!`, Tokio test macros),
top-level constant/import spans, and ordinary unit-size/window gaps remain.
Those need separate, more conservative decisions.

### BO.2 — default product metric

Full default `eval_by_language.py --rank extractability --top 0` after the change
did not move the product P@10 gate:

| split | overall P@10 | Rust P@10 | Rust worthy recall |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| dev | 63% [58-68] n=353 | 77% [65-88] n=57 | 318/411 |
| held-out | 56% [50-61] n=308 | 62% [50-74] n=58 | 227/255 |

Default worthy recall is essentially unchanged because these units are exact-unsafe
token-tree units. They mainly help the maximal/near recall probe and make macro-arm
duplication visible for review.

### BO.3 — Rust extraction surface

Measured across the 15 Rust corpus repos:

| Rust corpus scan metric | before | after | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| units kept | 93948 | 94507 | +559 |
| macro-arm units kept | 0 | 356 | +356 |
| candidate families | 4819 | 4826 | +7 |
| default-surface families | 4782 | 4789 | +7 |
| scan wall time sum | 5.808s | 5.860s | +0.052s |
| features wall time sum | 17.482s | 17.759s | +0.277s |

The new macro-arm units have exactly one raw boundary each. Their measured raw ratio
is not "mostly Raw": median 0.0667, mean 0.0634, max 0.125, with median token count
15 and range 8-145. The cost is small but nonzero: +7 default-surface families over
the Rust corpus. Verdict: keep `macro_rules!` arm units, but do not generalize to all
macro invocation bodies in this issue. The remaining Rust no-overlap records should
be handled as separate coverage questions because their blast radius is broader than
arm definitions.

## BP. The degenerate-fingerprint campaign — five erasure classes, a claim-scoped gate

The #193 oracle pass left 17 corpus repos flagging fingerprint-equal pairs with
concretely different behavior (#210). Chasing every pair to root cause found **five
distinct erasure classes** — each one a construct silently contributing *nothing* to the
value multiset, so "code that does X" fingerprinted like "code that doesn't":

1. **Python `try/except/else` dropped the `else` clause at lowering** (and Ruby routed
   `else` into handler position, where the no-throw convention erases it): black's
   try/import/else wrapper ≡ `return self`. Else statements now fold into the try body —
   they run exactly when the body completes without raising.
2. **C/Go/Rust lowered dereference STORE targets transparently** (`(*nr)++` became the
   dead local rebind `nr = nr + 1`): git's `inc_nr` callback merged with every
   `return 0` stub — 38 pairs in git alone, plus nginx/curl/minio/redis. A store
   target's deref now lowers as the computed place `Index(p, 0)`; deref *reads* keep
   peeling so `*x > 0` still converges with `x > 0`.
3. **The oracle's 2-arg scalar min/max fell into the 1-arg collection fold** on a List
   operand (`max([1,2,3,4], 7)` returned 4): the proof-backed 3-way selection canon
   (if-chain ≡ `Math.max` chain) was flagged as a false merge on commons-lang — an
   instrument bug, the merge was sound.
4. **Go type-switch cases (`type_case` nodes) lowered to an empty block**: hugo's
   recursive type-switch traversal fingerprinted identically to a constant stub — at
   exact-safe, length 10, a *reportable* exact-channel merge. Arms now survive under a
   raw test keyed by the case's type spelling.
5. **Three fidelity refinements**: try-handler erasure narrowed to provably
   non-throwing bodies (the pinned `return 1` convention survives; `try {return x+1}
   except {return x}` keeps its handler under an exception guard); element-free effects
   under a loop keyed by the loop's canonical element source (for-in over keys vs
   for-of over values no longer collide — prettier); and the oracle binds battery rows
   under each parameter's DECLARED type domain, the §BE convention extended to types
   (a typed `int` never receives a List, so rxjava's order-swapped typed field writes
   stop flagging on impossible type-states).

**The gate is now scoped to the claim.** Hard violations require the *product's* exact
surface on both sides (`exact_claim_eligible`: strict-exact-safe + the
`EXACT_VALUE_MIN` degenerate-size floor — the same two gates the exact channel and the
near value-accept already apply); collisions between lossy fingerprints are a
diagnostics lane, and symbolic-trace or declaration-divergent disagreements (units
whose declared domains differ are not battery-comparable row-for-row) are advisory
leads. **Result: `nose verify` reports SOUND — zero hard violations — on all 105
corpus repos**, including raylib for the first time (§BM-era work bounded its oracle
cost). Known residuals stay visible, not buried: same-spelling opaque calls inside
lossy fingerprints (the delve fixture class) sit in the diagnostics lane, and labeled
`break` erasure (`break outer` lowers like plain `break`) is noted as a follow-up.

**Recall/precision cost: zero.** An apples-to-apples v5 eval against the pre-campaign
binary on the same corpus shows identical P@10 (53% [48–58] dev / 55% [50–60] heldout,
both arms, per-language rows unchanged) with heldout worthy-recall *up* four labels
(Go +3, Python +1) — the erasure fixes split only behaviorally-different pairs, and
representing deref effects let a few previously stub-collapsed units group correctly.

## BQ. The evidence-index campaign — the quadratic scans behind `normalize+extract`

`NOSE_TIME=1` stage timing on the corpus showed `normalize+extract` at 95–97% of
scan cost (sympy: 20.5s of a 21s scan; redis: 6.9s of 7.4s), and the per-pass
`NOSE_TIME_NORMALIZE` aggregation put 92% of the normalize half in the four
evidence passes — call-target 35.6s, binding 14.3s, effect 21.7s, api 1.8s CPU
on sympy. The shape was always the same: **a per-node/per-call query running a
full linear scan of `il.evidence` (or `il.nodes`)** — O(n²) on evidence-dense
files. The span-keyed evidence index existed (`Il::evidence_anchored_at`), but
most consumers predated it.

What landed, all output-preserving (byte-identical scan JSON on
redis/git/tokio/guava/sympy/netty and the full test suite before/after):

1. **Every anchored evidence query goes through the index.**
   `find_or_push_first_party_evidence` (the emit-path dedup scan — quadratic on
   its own output), both evidence `upsert`s, the call-target/binding/library-api
   pass helpers, and ~15 anchored scans in `nose-semantics` now query the
   span bucket. `EvidenceIndex` gained a `by_binding_hash` bucket for the
   `Binding`-anchor-by-hash consumers and a `(id, span)` staleness sentinel so a
   `clear()`/`retain()`+re-push rebuilds instead of silently corrupting
   (a latent hazard a unit test exposed the moment more paths used the index).
2. **Two more lazy arena indexes on `Il`,** under the same nodes-are-immutable
   discipline as `scope_index`: `nodes_spanning` (span → nodes; kills the
   whole-arena `node_at_span*` scans in library-api span queries) and
   `assigns_in_scope` (nearest-scope → assigns; kills the whole-arena scan in
   `unique_binding_lhs_for_var_reference`, which ran per Var reference).
3. **`binding_evidence` inverted its mutation walk.** Per-binding
   `visit_scope_nodes` (O(assignments × scope size)) became one
   `ScopeMutationFacts` walk per scope harvesting names per site, with the
   shadow rule applied via per-nested-scope bound-name sets — same verdicts,
   one pass (sympy: 14.3s → 0.8s).
4. **The pure-inline registry is file-level, not per-unit.** `units::extract`
   rebuilt it per unit — every unit re-walked every function body
   (O(units × file), ~17s CPU on sympy, the dominant *block*-unit cost).
   `ValueFingerprintContext` now collects `InlineCandidate`s once per file with
   the safety check's global-name requirements *recorded* instead of resolved;
   per-unit admission (self-exclusion + required-globals ⊆ the unit's seeded
   `global_env`, snapshotted at adopt time) moved to the call site, and call
   resolution inverted from per-registry-entry evidence checks to one
   `direct_function_call_target_span_at_call` + span lookup. The context-free
   path shares the same mechanism (the old `inline_fns` map is gone).

**Result** (release, 10-core M-series, default `syntax,semantic` scan): sympy
20.0 → 4.7s wall (81.3 → 23.5s CPU), redis 3.9 → 1.0s, git 2.7 → 1.1s, netty
3.5 → 1.8s, guava 3.6 → 2.2s, tokio 0.5 → 0.3s — **2–4× end-to-end** with
byte-identical output. The dogfood gate caught one real near-duplicate the
refactor itself introduced (`path_cond`/`guarded` converged once both used the
same indexed loop) — deduped by making `guarded` call `path_cond`, count back
at 24.

The remaining cost after this campaign is the genuine per-unit value-graph
build (blocks dominate by count), no longer accidental quadratics. The design
lesson matches §T: hot-path evidence/node lookups must be index-backed by
default — a raw `il.evidence`/`il.nodes` iteration in a per-node helper is a
red flag in review.

## BR. Review fire-precision benchmark — consumer 2 gets its first measurement

[design](design.md) §3 raised "review-as-gate: harden it past v1 and define a
conservative fire policy" — but nothing measured the gate product itself: the v5
labelset owns the scan surface, and §BG measured hazard *ranking*, not whether
`nose review` fires correctly on a real change stream. #243 built that measurement
(`eval/review_fire/replay.py`): replay `nose review --base <parent>` at 25 sampled
first-parent commits in each of 14 corpus repos (7 languages × dev/heldout) — the
working tree holds the merged change, exactly the PR-gate situation — in two arms
(review's default `syntax,semantic`, and `+near`). Labeling unit: a fired change's
**top-ranked finding** (`--fail` is a per-change decision); 120 findings, §BG-gold
method — judge labels, then two adversarial refuters on every positive, a positive
survives only if both sustain.

**Result** (artifacts `eval/review_fire/{replay_summary,verdicts}_2026_06_11.*`,
narrative [eval/review_fire/RESULTS.md](../eval/review_fire/RESULTS.md)): the default
arm fires on **33.1%** of replayed merged changes (near arm 41.2%) at **4.2%** strict
top-1 precision (default 3.1%, near 5.5%). The five confirmed positives are three
unique, externally-validated misses — rubocop's `DataInheritance#correct_parent`
autocorrect bug (still latent upstream), rxjs's missing `AnimationFrameAction` guard
(**upstream later merged the equivalent fix, rxjs #7444, citing the same root
cause**), and tokio #7675 fixing five identical socket `Debug` impls but missing
`UdpSocket`. The false-fire taxonomy is the #245 gap list: **51%
`no_propagation_needed`** — the diff overlaps the member's *span* but not the
*shared logic* (review's overlap test is span-level; requiring overlap with the
family's shared/invariant lines targets exactly this bucket), 32% intentional
divergence (variant pairs — an ignore/ergonomics problem, not a threshold), 12%
not-a-clone (grouping artifacts).

Two reads. The gate problem is **dilution, not absence**: real un-propagated changes
exist in the wild at a useful rate (3 in 350 merged changes) and review's ordering
put them at top-1 — but a 33–41% fire rate at ~4% precision means `--fail` must stay
an explicitly-opted, policy-tuned gate ("a gate that cries wolf gets disabled" is now
a measured fact). And half the noise is one mechanical bucket, so the first #245
policy lever (shared-line overlap) is cheap and targeted, not judgment-deep. Protocol
limits recorded in RESULTS.md: top-1 only, 14 repos, and merged-PR replay sees only
the surviving change stream. A side catch: `--format json|sarif` printed a human
sentence on empty reviewable diffs (adds-only PRs) — fixed in #252.

## BS. Behavior-keyed miss mining — the vj<0.8 frontier, measured (go/no-go: NO-GO)

§BK's structural arm is blind below vj 0.8 by construction; #246 built the
complementary behavior-keyed arm (`bench/type4/behavior_miss_mining.py`) — §AU's
"oracle as generator" executed: candidates come from `nose verify --leads`
(units grouped by concrete battery behavior, under-merged groups exported with
their max-vj cross-fingerprint pair), so structure plays no part in candidate
generation. Run on all 105 corpus repos on the post-§BP/§BQ binary (raylib
included for the first time; zero mining failures), then classified: span/size
via file-scoped `nose features`, unreported = no maximal-surface
(`syntax,semantic,near --min-value 0`) family co-reports the pair, trivial =
below the 5-line/24-token product floor.

**Result** (`bench/type4/behavior_miss_mining_2026_06_11.json`): 163 leads
corpus-wide → **11** unreported non-trivial vj<0.8 pairs (5 Go, 5 C, 1 Python;
10 of 11 at text-similarity < 0.5). Judge + adversarial-refuter labeling of all
11 (`behavior_miss_verdicts_2026_06_11.jsonl`): **10 battery artifacts** —
agreement only on degenerate battery behavior (both echo the input, both
return 0/false/reject on non-matching inputs, both hit empty-input fast
paths) while the success branches compute unrelated things — and **one genuine
worthy miss**, refuter-sustained: redis `deps/hiredis/sds.c`
`hi_sdsll2str` ↔ `hi_sdsull2str` (vj 0.33), token-identical digit-emit/reverse
helpers whose own comment says "Identical …, but for unsigned long long type";
redis's mainline `ll2string` already ships the merged form this pair refactors
to. (Why even near misses it: vj 0.33 is far below value-accept and the sign
branch changes the shape enough to split candidates — and at text 0.88 it is
not even the deep-Type-4 shape this arm was hunting.)

**Verdict — NO-GO for a recall mechanism, the §BJ discipline answer.** The
oracle-visible different-algorithm Type-4 frontier is one worthy pair per 105
repos; everything else the behavior key surfaces is degenerate-agreement noise.
Combined with §BJ (sub-DAG ceiling 0.6–2.0%) and §BK (~600 mostly-scaffolding
pairs at vj ≥ 0.8), every measured recall frontier is now small: worthy-recall
is bounded by unit extraction and judgment, not by missing matching machinery.
Instrument limits, stated: only interpretable units participate (~29% of units,
concrete-trace lane; §BL.1), and each behavior group contributes one
representative pair — so this measures the *oracle-visible* frontier, not the
absolute one. The cheap re-run path when #244 widens the oracle (symbolic-
condition path exploration raises interpretable coverage): re-run `mine` —
the arm is corpus-pinned, deterministic, and now ~30 minutes wall.

## BT. Collection-kind closure — the L5/L6 audit, and the Ruby for-in/shovel residue

#247 set out to "close the L5/L6 builder-loop exact-channel asymmetry" — and the
first finding was that **most of it had already shipped** in the semantic-kernel
tranche, with `bench/type4/coverage_leads.md`'s body text stale against its own
✅ headers: Go's composite-literal kinds are distinguished at lowering (`array` /
map / `go_struct`), Go functional append and Java's import-proven
`new ArrayList` + `.add` both converge with the comprehension form, each locked by
equivalence tests with struct/unimported/shadowed hard negatives. Ruby `each`/`map`
on bare receivers stay closed **by design** (no Enumerable inference from a method
name — a pack supplies receiver proof). The audit-then-implement shape mattered:
the issue as written would have rebuilt existing machinery.

The genuine residue was Ruby's receiver-proof-free path, and it was two small
defects deep:

1. **Every Ruby `for` loop was out of the exact channel**: tree-sitter-ruby wraps
   the iterable in an `in` node (`for x in xs` → `value: (in (identifier))`), and
   `lower_for` lowered the wrapper — an exact-unsafe `Raw("in")` that also blocked
   `Elem(xs)` recognition. Fixed at the frontend (lower the wrapped expression).
2. **The shovel had no sound admission path**: `out << e` is `BinOp(Shl)` — shift
   on integers, append on arrays, anything on objects. `ruby_shovel_append_parts`
   (nose-semantics) now recognizes the *form only*; admission rides the existing
   active-builder proof — the receiver must be seeded by a proven empty list
   literal, the same `ActiveCollectionBuilder` contract the method form uses. An
   integer-seeded `<<` stays a shift; a parameter receiver never builds.

Result: Ruby `out = []; for x in xs; out << x*x; end; out` is exact-safe and
fingerprint-identical to the Python comprehension/builder loop (and the bare
ruby `for` ≡ python `for`). Validation per the standing discipline: equivalence
tests + 3 adjacent hard negatives (different contribution / integer shift /
unproven parameter receiver); `nose verify` SOUND + canon PRESERVED on
rubocop/fastlane/sidekiq/jekyll/asciidoctor; maximal-surface scan diff across 7
Ruby corpus repos: **zero locations lost, zero gained** — idiomatic Ruby uses
`each`, so the axis closes the §4b cross-language `exact_safe` evenness gap, not
a corpus-recall gap (the §BO macro-arm shape). Builder ≡ comprehension now holds
in the exact channel for python/js/ts/rust/go/java + ruby-for-in; C has no
comparable idiom.

## BU. Bounded symbolic-condition path exploration — conditioned, never guessed

The §BL census's top residual — branch-on-symbolic units (`kind:If` excl-share
92%) — named a step deliberately not taken: control flow is never guessed. #244
takes it without guessing: when an If/ternary condition evaluates to a symbolic
value, the oracle now explores BOTH arms (depth-first, true-arm first,
deterministic), recording each assumption in the effect trace as a `Sym` marker
(`assume ⊕ cond ⊕ arm`). The decision is *conditioned*, not guessed: two units
compare equal only when their assumptions AND outcomes align. Three design locks:

- **advisory by construction** — the assume marker keeps every explored path's
  behavior symbolic, so a cross-unit disagreement involving an explored path can
  only ever reach the advisory lane (`has_sym`), never the hard SOUND gate; canon
  preservation likewise stays concrete-only (canonicalization may merge the very
  branches exploration forks on);
- **fail-closed cap** — at most 3 symbolic decision sites per execution (≤ 8
  paths per battery row); past it the unit bails as a new, census-visible
  `path-bail` (2,101 units corpus-wide). While/ForEach conditions stay strict —
  an assumption per iteration is an unbounded chain, not a bounded fork;
- **the strict contract is untouched** — `run_unit` (canon validation, the
  fragment oracle) still bails on a symbolic condition; only `nose verify`'s
  battery uses the exploring `run_unit_paths`.

**Result** (105-repo census, both binaries, same corpus:
`oracle_exclusion_census_post_paths_2026_06_11.json`; verify **SOUND on all
105 repos**, canon PRESERVED, raylib within its §BL.2 budget):

| | pre-#244 | post-#244 | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| interpretable units | 174,881 (29.2%) | 187,650 (31.3%) | **+12,769 (+2.1pp)** |
| verified merge pairs | 1,073,454 (31.5%) | 1,076,080 (31.6%) | +2,626 (+0.1pp) |
| path-bail (fail-closed, visible) | — | 2,101 | |

**The honest read is double-edged.** The instrument gain is real — ~12.8k units
that bailed on a symbolic branch now interpret, and the behavior-keyed mining arm
(§BS) gets a wider candidate source for its cheap re-runs. But the *pair-mass*
needle barely moves: the unverified 68.5% → 68.4%. The §BL attribution listed
`kind:If` at 92% excl-share, yet conditioning on branches recovers only 0.1pp of
pair mass — i.e. the units behind the unverified bulk are excluded for SEVERAL
reasons at once (opaque statements, unsupported shapes, sheer size), and no single
construct unlock will move it. That refines the campaign order the census set in
§BL: the remaining oracle-completeness work is broad-spectrum statement coverage,
not another control-flow mechanism — and given §BS measured the frontier this
instrument feeds at one worthy pair per 105 repos, further oracle-completeness
investment should wait for a consumer that needs it.
