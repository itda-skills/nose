# Refactoring ratchets

nose keeps code quality pressure as ratchets: existing debt can be carried
temporarily, but it must not grow, and any real improvement should lower the
accepted ceiling in the same change.

The repository already ratchets function complexity and length through
[`clippy.toml`](../clippy.toml), test coverage through `cargo llvm-cov`, and
self-duplication through [`scripts/check-duplication.sh`](../scripts/check-duplication.sh).
The Rust file-length ratchet adds a coarser module-design signal on top.

## Rust file length

Run the gate directly with:

```sh
python3 scripts/check-file-lengths.py
```

The target is 600 lines for every Rust file under `crates/`. Files already above
that line are recorded in
[`scripts/file-length-budgets.json`](../scripts/file-length-budgets.json). A
budgeted file fails the gate if it grows. It also fails if it shrinks without its
budget being lowered, so the accepted ceiling moves down whenever a refactor pays
down debt. The budget map should stay empty once all Rust files are below the
target.

CI runs the gate against the base ref with `--ratchet-base`, so the budget
file itself cannot be loosened in the same change: `default_max_lines` may not
increase, existing file budgets may not increase, and new over-target budget
entries are rejected.

Do not use the budget file to bless newly large modules. New modules should stay
under the 600-line target; if a split still produces a larger file, keep looking
for a sharper boundary.

## Refactoring direction

File length is a symptom, not the objective. Prefer changes that make ownership
and behavior easier to reason about:

- separate CLI orchestration from query planning, rendering, config parsing, and
  file/process effects;
- keep the CLI binary root focused on process setup and subcommand dispatch;
  argument models, legacy detect/IL adapters, scan baseline handling, graded
  witness enrichment, opportunity grouping, source-line diff/proposal logic,
  human/markdown/SARIF scan rendering, and CLI-side timing helpers now live in
  dedicated `nose-cli/src/{cli_args,detect_command,il_command,scan_*,timing}.rs`
  modules;
- keep the CLI binary root as the process entry point only; command dispatch,
  scan/review detection setup, path diagnostics, terminal styling, runtime
  setup, shared report text, and CLI-root tests now live in
  `nose-cli/src/{command_dispatch,detect_pipeline,path_utils,style,runtime,report_text,main_tests/*}.rs`;
- keep divergent-edit review split by adapter boundary; review detection policy,
  git/worktree diff plumbing, output formats, and tests now live under
  `nose-cli/src/review/`;
- keep `nose-il` roots as API indexes; units/domains/evidence facets, the arena
  and lazy indexes, the builder/corpus wrappers, node core/domain/evidence/source
  facts, and node operators now live in focused `nose-il/src/{unit*,il,builder,corpus,node/*}.rs`
  modules;
- keep shared verify-oracle support outside the command dispatcher; the oracle
  battery, behavior hashing, and behavioral-gate tally now live in
  `nose-cli/src/oracle_gate.rs`;
- keep `nose verify` collection separate from presentation; JSON, exclusion,
  soundness, completeness, calibration, and falsification output now live in
  `nose-cli/src/verify_report.rs`;
- keep the verify oracle's per-file collection path separate from command
  parsing; interpreted records, exclusion accounting, and canon-preservation
  collection now live in `nose-cli/src/verify_collect.rs`;

  `value-census`, `stats`, `eval`, and `ceiling` now live in
  `nose-cli/src/diagnostic_commands.rs`;

  orchestration outside the dispatcher; they now live in
  `nose-cli/src/scan_commands.rs`;

  dispatcher; the JSON/markdown/human/SARIF format switch, hotspots, and
  reinvented-helper report section now live in `nose-cli/src/scan_report.rs`;

  IL builders, semantic-evidence recording, import facts, parse/file setup,
  post-lower evidence helpers, expression helpers, and lowering tests now live
  in focused `nose-frontend/src/lower/*` modules;
- keep wide frontend language roots as dispatch surfaces instead of mixed
  parser-policy files; JS/TS import parsing, type declarations, declarations,
  control-flow rewrites, expression lowering, global-symbol proof, record-shape
  guards, JSX lowering, operators, syntax helpers, and tests now live in
  focused `nose-frontend/src/js_ts/*` modules;

  `Value`, `Behavior`, symbolic containment, and declared-domain coercion now
  live in `nose-normalize/src/interp/value.rs`;

  factories/access/membership, and integer min/max/clamp calls now live in
  focused `nose-normalize/src/value_graph/stdlib/*` modules;
- keep value-graph tests as a thin suite root plus domain modules; builder,
  factory, guard, library API, membership, promise, sequence-surface, source
  evidence, and shared fixture helpers now live under
  `nose-normalize/src/value_graph/tests/`;

  fragments, loop-effect fragments, fragment context-safety, and unit tests now
  live in focused `nose-detect/src/units/*` modules;
- keep strict exact-safety policy fail-closed but locally owned; fact collection,
  tree entry points, HoF/comprehension safety, primitive literal/sequence gates,
  static index membership, call dispatch, collection/map receivers, factory/map

  suites, and graded-witness anti-unification now live in focused
  `nose-detect/src/{options,detectors,model,locations,reinvented,orchestration,candidates,report/*,witness/*}.rs`
  modules;
- move reusable semantic or detection rules toward the owning library crate
  instead of keeping them in `nose-cli`;
- split wide language and IL dispatch only around real concepts, such as
  expression lowering, declaration facts, effect evidence, or value-graph state;
- keep table-driven and cross-language tests readable by extracting shared
  fixtures only when the name explains the scenario being tested;
- keep exact-fragment CLI fixture scanning and family-selection helpers outside
  the oversized test body; shared exact-fragment test support now lives in
  `nose-cli/tests/cli/exact_fragments/support.rs`;
- keep Java `this` field exact-fragment scenarios together in their own CLI
  test module; assignment, guarded branch, body, and fluent `return this`

  command-surface, exact-fragment, and semantic-idiom scenarios now live under
  `nose-cli/tests/cli/{commands,exact_fragments,semantic_idioms}/`;
- lower a file budget only in the same change that makes the corresponding
  design boundary clearer.

When a large file is reduced below 600 lines, remove its entry from
`scripts/file-length-budgets.json`.
