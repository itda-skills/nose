# Recall-loss recovery loop

The recall-loss recovery loop turns `nose verify --recall-loss-report` from a
one-off artifact into a semantic-kernel process. The goal is to make exact
semantic admission stricter or equally strict while reducing unattributed recall
loss. When recall cannot be recovered safely, the loop records the missing
capability or the intentional unsupported boundary.

## Baselines

Checked-in summaries live under [bench/recall_loss](../bench/recall_loss/):

- [crates baseline](../bench/recall_loss/crates.baseline.v1.json) records the
  current `crates` surface.
- [corpus-slice baseline](../bench/recall_loss/corpus-slice.baseline.v1.json)
  records a small mixed-language slice across Go, Python, Ruby, TypeScript,
  Rust, and Swift.
- [#570 cycle log](../bench/recall_loss/issue-570-cycles.v1.json) records the
  first five top-bucket cycles and the unsupported runtime boundary decision.
- [#572 cycle log](../bench/recall_loss/issue-572-cycle.v1.json) records the
  first post-#570 refinement cycle, which splits expression-statement effect
  boundaries and Rust macro source surfaces out of the callee-identity bucket.
- [#574 callee census](../bench/recall_loss/issue-574-callee-census.v1.json)
  records the remaining callee-identity bucket by language and call-target
  surface for the #567 import-backed immutable provenance epic.
- [#576 cycle log](../bench/recall_loss/issue-576-cycle.v1.json) records the
  first recovery slice after the census: Rust brace `use` declarations now emit
  per-item imported symbol evidence that feeds the existing imported
  call-target producer.
- [#578 cycle log](../bench/recall_loss/issue-578-cycle.v1.json) records the
  next Rust scoped-path recovery slice: scoped calls whose root already has
  dependency-backed import evidence now emit imported member call-target proof.
- [#580 cycle log](../bench/recall_loss/issue-580-cycle.v1.json) records the
  Rust struct-expression surface slice: struct literals now carry exact-safe
  `SequenceSurface` proof, which closes the imported-member target-present
  follow-ups exposed by #578 while keeping raw sequences closed.
- [#582 cycle log](../bench/recall_loss/issue-582-cycle.v1.json) records the
  receiver-domain recovery slice: iterator-adapter result domains,
  dependency-backed literal binding domains, normalized binding proof-chain
  admission, and mutation-closed strict exact receiver use.
- [#567 phase 1 JS/TS constructor log](../bench/recall_loss/issue-567-phase1-js-ts-constructors.v1.json)
  records imported immutable provider snapshots for JS/TS `new Map(...)` and
  `new Set(...)`, reusing existing constructor `LibraryApi` proof across the
  import boundary.
- [#567 phase 2 collection factory log](../bench/recall_loss/issue-567-phase2-collection-factories.v1.json)
  records imported immutable provider snapshots for existing Python and Java
  collection factory contracts, reusing `LibraryApi` proof and exact-safe
  provider arguments across the import boundary.
- [#567 phase 3 import-snapshot census log](../bench/recall_loss/issue-567-phase3-import-snapshot-census.v1.json)
  records the reporting closeout: local recall-loss reports now expose
  successful snapshot counts plus unresolved binding-import miss reasons, so the
  next imported-value slice can be selected from corpus evidence.
- [#567 phase 4 aggregate-boundary triage log](../bench/recall_loss/issue-567-phase4-aggregate-boundary-triage.v1.json)
  records the first census-driven triage pass: the broad provider-aggregate miss
  bucket is split into non-import-literal sequence surfaces and child reference
  boundaries without admitting new snapshots.
- [#567 closeout log](../bench/recall_loss/issue-567-closeout.v1.json)
  records the epic-level audit: requirement coverage, exact-safe imported
  coordinate families, hard-negative inventory, hard-gate status, and runtime
  measurements. The narrative closeout is
  [import-backed immutable provenance closeout](import-backed-immutable-provenance-closeout-567.md).
- [#587 module/export census](../bench/recall_loss/issue-587-module-export-census.v1.json)
  records the starting point for the follow-up import-snapshot milestone:
  provider module/export miss counts by reason, crate, import surface, top
  files, and recommended implementation order.
- [post-#587 census](../bench/recall_loss/post-587-census.v1.json) records the
  current `crates` recall-loss shape after the #587 closeout: generic
  provider-module misses are gone on the checked surface, and the next
  capability targets are receiver-domain proof, callee identity, and
  mutation/effect contracts.
- [full corpus priority census](../bench/recall_loss/corpus-priority-census-2026-06-28.v1.json)
  records the first 120-repo follow-up: it combines per-repo recall-loss reports
  with lexical stdlib/API source prevalence so the next semantic-kernel work is
  selected from the pinned corpus instead of from `crates` alone.

Regenerate the full local reports with:

The census has two signals: `recall_loss` is oracle/strict-admission evidence,
while `source_scan` is lexical source prevalence for pricing stdlib/API
surfaces. Source prevalence never admits semantics by itself.

## Cycle Contract

Each semantic-kernel cycle records:

- the baseline report and selected reason bucket;
- representative fixture or linked existing fixture;
- whether the result is recovered, classified actionable, precision-hardened, or
  intentionally unsupported;
- before/after hard gate numbers;
- before/after recall-loss bucket numbers;
- docs and changelog updates.

The hard gate is not negotiable:

- `false_merges == 0`;
- `canon_preservation_violations == 0`.

The soft gate is attribution quality. A stricter admission change may increase
rejections, but the increase must land in a structured bucket with a named
capability, fixture, and follow-up policy.

## #570 Starting Result

The first coarse `crates` baseline had `758` units in the opaque
`strict-exact-unsafe` bucket. The #570 attribution pass reduced
`unattributed-strict-exact-unsafe` to `0` while preserving false merges `0` and
canon-preservation violations `0`.

The #572 refinement keeps the same hard gate while moving expression-statement
effect boundaries and unmodeled Rust macro invocations out of the
callee-identity bucket. That sharpens the remaining exact-recovery target: pure
scoped/path callees still need reusable symbol/callee evidence, while discarded
call results and unmodeled macro expansion stay closed.

The #574 census keeps the `import-symbol-callee-identity-proof-missing` count at
`264` but makes the inside of that bucket actionable. On `crates`, the remaining
units are overwhelmingly Rust (`261/264`). The largest call-target surfaces are
local-or-parameter calls (`115`), member calls (`92`), and scoped-path calls
(`45`). That points the next implementation slice at Rust local/scoped path
call-target proof before expanding the same evidence shape into broader
import-backed immutable value provenance under #567.

The #576 recovery slice reduces the callee-identity bucket from `264` to `251`
without changing the hard gate (`false_merges == 0`,
`canon_preservation_violations == 0`). It does this by proving Rust brace import
bindings such as `use crate::m::{f, T};` as per-item `Import`/`Symbol` evidence
while leaving wildcard imports, nested brace imports, and `self`/`super`-relative
brace prefixes closed. This shrinks the local-or-parameter primary surface from
`115` to `71`; the next dominant targets are scoped paths and member calls.

The #578 recovery slice reduces the callee-identity bucket from `251` to `235`
while preserving the same hard gate. It proves only import-backed Rust scoped
calls: a lowered scoped callee such as `Span::new` can emit
`CallTarget::ImportedMember` when `Span` has a unique static imported binding or
namespace proof. Raw `crate::...`, `self::...`, `super::...`,
`std/core/alloc::...`, unimported roots, and ambiguous roots remain closed. The
scoped-path primary surface drops from `72` to `50`; the remaining dominant
surface is now member/receiver call-target proof, with two newly exposed
`imported-member-target-present-call-contract-proof` follow-ups.

The #580 recovery slice reduces overall exact-admission rejections from `735` to
`707` and the callee-identity bucket from `235` to `221`, again with
`false_merges == 0` and `canon_preservation_violations == 0`. It does not loosen
untagged `Seq`: Rust struct literals now lower as `Seq("rust_struct_expression")`
and must carry matching `SequenceSurface::RustStructExpression` evidence. That
surface is exact-tree-safe but is not a collection, map, membership receiver,
map-entry list, or imported literal proof. This closes the
`imported-member-target-present-call-contract-proof` primary surface (`2 -> 0`),
reduces member-call primary loss (`98 -> 93`), and removes many Rust struct
literal source-surface losses (`73 -> 52`). Newly exact-safe but too-small units
move to the explicit value-fingerprint floor bucket (`6 -> 13`).

After #580 and before the receiver-domain slice, the top `crates` buckets were:

| reason | count | next capability |
|---|---:|---|
| `receiver-domain-proof-missing` | 241 | receiver-domain evidence instead of selector spelling |
| `import-symbol-callee-identity-proof-missing` | 221 | reusable member/receiver callee identity evidence |
| `mutation-effect-boundary` | 131 | effect and place contracts |
| `source-surface-proof-missing` | 52 | Rust macro/source-surface contracts and construct/operator/comprehension evidence |
| `hof-demand-effect-proof-missing` | 28 | HOF demand/effect/materialization profile |
| `unsupported-runtime-boundary` | 14 | intentional fail-closed runtime/protocol boundary |

These are capability gaps, not feature requests. A future PR should close a
bucket by adding reusable evidence or an admission capability, not by adding a
one-off API exception.

The #582 receiver-domain recovery slice keeps the hard gates closed while adding
local infrastructure for iterator-adapter result domains and call-node
receiver-domain consumption. Rust `iter`/`into_iter`/`iter_mut`/`copied`/
`cloned` and Java `stream` now emit `Iterator` result-domain evidence; Rust
`to_vec` emits `Collection`; Rust `collect` remains closed because its result
type is caller-selected. Strict exact consumers now read asserted `Domain`
evidence anchored to call receivers, and typed `const`/`static`/`let` plus
literal assignments emit binding-domain evidence from existing
SequenceSurface/Domain proof. Canonical builtin admission now follows the
binding proof chain after normalization inlines the receiver value, while strict
exact still closes receiver-domain use when `ReceiverMutation` evidence appears
before the use. The local `crates` run moved `receiver-domain-proof-missing`
from `241` to `239`, with `false_merges == 0`,
`canon_preservation_violations == 0`, and completeness improving from `38/82`
to `39/83`. Total exact-admission rejections moved `707 -> 708`; the increase
lands in structured callee-identity/HOF/library-API occurrence buckets, not in
unattributed unsafe exact admission. The remaining receiver-domain cases still
point at cross-file field/constant domain provenance, not more
selector-specific iterator exceptions.

The #567 phase 1 JS/TS constructor slice keeps the hard gates closed while
opening imported immutable snapshots for provider-owned `new Map(...)` and
`new Set(...)`. This does not add new API shapes: provider export safety now
reuses the existing `JsLikeMapConstructor` and `JsLikeSetConstructor`
`LibraryApi` occurrence proofs, including construct syntax and unshadowed-global
callee obligations, before copying the provider evidence into the importer.
Focused product fixtures move JS/TS imported Map defaults from `0/2` to `2/2`
supported positives and JS/TS imported Set membership from `0/2` to `2/2`,
while missing constructor evidence, provider-local `Map`/`Set` shadows,
provider/importer mutation, wrong contents, and raw import-coordinate sequences
stay closed. The full `crates` recall-loss report remains at
`false_merges == 0` and `canon_preservation_violations == 0`; admission
rejections move `708 -> 710` because this PR adds new Rust test/helper units,
and the increase is attributed to the existing callee-identity bucket.

The #567 phase 2 collection-factory slice applies the same capability path to
existing collection factory contracts instead of adding selector exceptions.
Provider export safety now admits provider-owned collection-factory calls only
through already-admitted `LibraryApi` occurrence proof plus exact-safe literal
arguments. The product fixture delta is Python imported collection membership
`0/2 -> 2/2` for builtin `set([...])` and imported
`collections.deque([...])`, and Java imported collection membership
`0/2 -> 2/2` for static-imported `List.of(...)` and `Set.of(...)` provider
bindings. Missing `LibraryApi` proof, provider-local factory shadowing,
provider/importer mutation, wrong contents, and ambiguous single-argument
`Arrays.asList(...)` provider snapshots remain closed. The full `crates`
recall-loss report remains at `false_merges == 0` and
`canon_preservation_violations == 0`; admission rejections move `710 -> 711`
because this PR adds new test/helper units, and the increase is attributed to
the existing import-symbol callee-identity bucket.

The #567 phase 3 reporting closeout adds `import_snapshot_census` to local
recall-loss reports. This is reporting-only: it does not admit new snapshots or
change clone families. The full `crates` report remains at `false_merges == 0`
and `canon_preservation_violations == 0`; admission rejections move
`711 -> 716` because the reporting implementation and CLI fixture add new Rust
test/helper units. The new census shows that `crates` currently has `0`
successful imported snapshot records and `384` unresolved binding imports:
`provider-module-missing` `255`, `provider-export-missing` `123`,
`importer-binding-mutated` `3`, and
`provider-aggregate-children-not-exact-safe` `3`. That makes the next
imported-value decision explicit: most `crates` misses are module/export
resolution scope, while the provider-aggregate slice is the small triage target.

The #567 phase 4 aggregate-boundary triage follows that target and keeps
imported snapshot admission unchanged. The broad
`provider-aggregate-children-not-exact-safe` bucket moves `3 -> 0`: two cases
are Rust `pub use context::...` re-export paths reported as
`provider-sequence-surface-not-import-literal-safe`, and one case is the
compiled semantic-pack descriptor table assembled from indexed descriptor
references, reported as `provider-aggregate-child-reference-boundary`. The full
`crates` report remains at `false_merges == 0` and
`canon_preservation_violations == 0`; completeness stays `39/83`, and
admission rejections move `716 -> 717` because this diagnostics-only pass adds
new Rust semantic tests. The decision is to keep these closed: admitting them as
snapshots would treat references as literal provider values.

The current top `crates` buckets after #567 phase 4 are:

| reason | count | next capability |
|---|---:|---|
| `receiver-domain-proof-missing` | 240 | cross-file field/constant domain provenance |
| `import-symbol-callee-identity-proof-missing` | 227 | reusable member/receiver callee identity evidence |
| `mutation-effect-boundary` | 133 | effect and place contracts |
| `source-surface-proof-missing` | 52 | Rust macro/source-surface contracts and construct/operator/comprehension evidence |
| `hof-demand-effect-proof-missing` | 30 | HOF demand/effect/materialization profile |
| `unsupported-runtime-boundary` | 14 | intentional fail-closed runtime/protocol boundary |
| `value-fingerprint-too-small` | 13 | explicit low-substance floor policy |
| `library-api-occurrence-proof-missing` | 8 | missing occurrence evidence, not selector spelling |

The #567 closeout keeps that phase-4 decision intact. The epic is complete as an
imported immutable value capability: product fixtures now cover the supported
map-default, membership, and string-affix coordinate families; hard negatives
remain closed; and import-snapshot misses are measurable. The follow-up is not
to relax aggregate child export safety. The remaining large census buckets are
module/export resolution scope and should be planned as a separate milestone if
import snapshots remain the priority.

Issue #587 is that separate milestone. Its starting census selects the
`provider-module-missing` and `provider-export-missing` rows from the #567
closeout report: `378` rows, all Rust. The largest clearly same-repo first slice
is `provider-export-missing` on `crate::...` imports (`68` rows). Before opening
that slice, split unsupported stdlib, external crate, and workspace-crate imports
out of the actionable module-resolution bucket so package semantics stay closed.

The #587 initial module-resolution slice applies that split and opens only the
literal-safe part of same-repo Rust module lookup. Rust file identity now treats
`src/lib.rs`, `src/main.rs`, and `mod.rs` as crate/module owners, and imported
snapshot lookup derives `self::...`/`super::...` aliases from the importer and
provider file identities before accepting a provider-owned immutable literal.
Non-value exports stay closed but are no longer mixed into generic miss buckets:
callables, type exports, module namespaces, Rust stdlib imports, and workspace
crate imports now have separate census reasons. On `crates`, the generic
module/export target moved `378 -> 139` (`provider-module-missing` `255 -> 130`,
`provider-export-missing` `123 -> 9`) while successful imported snapshot records
move `0 -> 1`; hard gates remain at `false_merges == 0` and
`canon_preservation_violations == 0`. The checked-in measurement is
[`issue-587-module-resolution-1-3.v1.json`](../bench/recall_loss/issue-587-module-resolution-1-3.v1.json).

The #587 direct re-export slice adds proof for public Rust `pub use` bindings
without treating re-export syntax as value proof. The lowerer now emits
first-party `ReExportBinding` evidence for direct public `use` declarations,
and corpus import resolution follows one same-corpus re-export hop only when the
target is already a unique literal-safe provider export. Private `use`,
wildcard/nested brace forms, ambiguous re-exports, and non-value targets remain
closed. The same slice also recognizes same-crate bare child module aliases such
as `context::Item` from a parent module file. On `crates`, existing re-exports
mostly point at types and callables rather than literal provider values, so
successful imported snapshot records stay `1`; the generic module/export target
rows move `139 -> 91`, `provider-module-missing` moves `130 -> 89`, and
`provider-export-missing` moves `9 -> 2`, with direct re-export targets priced
as `provider-reexport-*` boundary reasons. Hard gates remain at
`false_merges == 0` and `canon_preservation_violations == 0`. The checked-in
measurement is
[`issue-587-reexport-pricing.v1.json`](../bench/recall_loss/issue-587-reexport-pricing.v1.json).

The #587 residual census checks whether another same-repo provider-resolution
slice is warranted before widening implementation. After the re-export slice
and diagnostics module split, the remaining generic module/export target is
`92` rows, or `93` if the re-export target-export tail is included. Most of
that is not same-repo module resolution: `76` rows are external crate imports
(`rustc_hash`, `tree_sitter`, `anyhow`, `serde`, `regex`, `clap`, `ignore`),
`1` is a residual workspace-crate boundary gap, and `2` are residual
`std::cell` rows. The same-repo tail is much smaller: `11` relative-`super`
rows and `2` local export misses. The next
implementation slice should therefore split external/std/workspace residuals
out of `provider-module-missing` as explicit closed boundaries before deciding
whether the relative-`super` tail is worth opening. The checked-in measurement
is
[`issue-587-residual-census.v1.json`](../bench/recall_loss/issue-587-residual-census.v1.json).

The #587 residual boundary split implements that diagnostics-only step. Known
external crate imports now report as `provider-external-crate-boundary`,
residual `std::cell` imports join `provider-rust-stdlib-boundary`, and the
remaining `nose_il::UnitKind` type-namespace import joins
`provider-workspace-crate-boundary`. This does not admit new snapshot values;
it only prices closed boundaries more accurately. On `crates`,
`provider-module-missing` moves `90 -> 11`, generic module/export target rows
move `92 -> 13`, and the residual set including the re-export target-export tail
moves `93 -> 14`. Successful imported snapshot records stay `1`; hard gates
remain at `false_merges == 0` and `canon_preservation_violations == 0`. The
checked-in measurement is
[`issue-587-residual-boundary-split.v1.json`](../bench/recall_loss/issue-587-residual-boundary-split.v1.json).

The #587 relative-`super` closeout handles the last generic Rust
`provider-module-missing` rows. Importer-relative provider lookup already knew
how to build aliases such as `super::child`; the missing case was when the
import names the parent module itself, such as `use super::Item` or
`use super::super::Item`. That alias now resolves to the same-crate parent or
grandparent module provider. On `crates`, `provider-module-missing` moves
`11 -> 0`, generic module/export target rows move `13 -> 2`, and the residual
set including the re-export target-export tail moves `14 -> 3`. The moved rows
remain closed as non-value boundaries (`provider-callable-export-boundary`,
`provider-type-export-boundary`, or `provider-reexport-type-boundary`) rather
than becoming snapshot values; successful imported snapshot records stay `1`,
with `false_merges == 0` and `canon_preservation_violations == 0`. The remaining
tail is export-only (`2` local export misses and `1` re-export target export
miss), so #587's module-missing work is complete. The checked-in measurement is
[`issue-587-relative-super-closeout.v1.json`](../bench/recall_loss/issue-587-relative-super-closeout.v1.json).

The post-#587 census confirms that import-snapshot module/provider-missing work
is no longer the leading recall-loss surface on `crates`. The current checked
run has `0` false merges and `0` canon-preservation violations, `726`
structured exact-admission rejections, and `39/83` behavior-equal pairs
converged by exact fingerprints. The largest buckets are
`receiver-domain-proof-missing` (`244`), `import-symbol-callee-identity-proof-missing`
(`231`), and `mutation-effect-boundary` (`134`). The import snapshot census now
has `1` successful Rust snapshot and `388` unresolved binding imports, but the
remaining rows are explicit closed boundaries: callable exports (`110`),
external crates (`76`), type exports (`69`), Rust stdlib (`50`), workspace
crates (`48`), module namespaces (`20`), small re-export tails, mutation, and
two local export misses. The next milestone should therefore move to reusable
receiver-domain or member-call identity proof before more import-snapshot
resolution work. The checked-in measurement is
[`post-587-census.v1.json`](../bench/recall_loss/post-587-census.v1.json).

The 2026-06-28 full corpus priority census broadens that view from `crates` to
all 120 pinned repos. The hard gate remains closed (`false_merges == 0` and
`canon_preservation_violations == 0`), but the leading recall-loss buckets are
different at product scale: mutation/effect contracts (`71,884`), callee
identity (`50,322`), unsupported runtime boundaries (`20,128`), and value
fingerprint floor (`16,006`). The first full-corpus run also exposes a process
gap that `crates` did not show: `unattributed-strict-exact-unsafe` is `1,896`,
mostly Python (`1,429`), so future cycles must continue reducing that bucket
while widening exact admission.

The same census adds a separate stdlib/API source-prevalence scan. Raw
prevalence is led by C string/memory and allocation calls, but those are
high-risk pointer/effect/lifetime surfaces. The safer initial semantic-kernel
order is therefore: Go `strings` transforms, Java `Optional`, Java
Arrays/Collections partial-coverage audit, Go `sort`/`slices`/`maps`, and
Python HOF/runtime attribution before widening `itertools`/`functools`. This is
still a pricing result, not semantic proof; every slice must add fixtures,
before/after recall-loss counts, and the same hard gate evidence. The checked
summary is
[`corpus-priority-census-2026-06-28.v1.json`](../bench/recall_loss/corpus-priority-census-2026-06-28.v1.json).

The first concrete slice from that order admits Go `strings.Join` only through
imported namespace proof and reuses the existing ordered `Join` builtin instead
of adding a narrower feature-specific semantic. Trim, split, replace, and case
transforms remain closed until they have equivalent value semantics and hard
negative fixtures.

The Java `Optional` slice starts with fully-qualified `java.util.Optional<T>`
receiver proof for `isPresent()` and `orElse(default)`. Bare imported
`Optional<T>` remains closed deliberately; the next capability needed there is
import-backed Java type-domain proof, not another one-off Optional feature row.
