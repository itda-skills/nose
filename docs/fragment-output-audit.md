# Exact fragment output audit

This audit records how current exact semantic fragment output behaves from a
user's point of view. It is a read-only product audit: no detector semantics,
ranking implementation, or fragment families changed. Back to
[clone-types](clone-types.md), [scan-json](scan-json.md), and
[review](review.md).

The work was prompted by
[issue #35](https://github.com/corca-ai/nose/issues/35) and feeds the product
surface work tracked in [#45](https://github.com/corca-ai/nose/issues/45):

- [#33](https://github.com/corca-ai/nose/issues/33) exposed stable fragment kind
  and internal proof metadata.
- [#45](https://github.com/corca-ai/nose/issues/45) exposes the stable product
  metadata while keeping proof facts internal.
- [#11](https://github.com/corca-ai/nose/issues/11) should define stable
  family-level refactorability and actionability reason codes.
- [#23](https://github.com/corca-ai/nose/issues/23) should consume review-hazard
  metadata without treating every exact fragment as a direct extraction.

## Pre-#33 Observable Audit

Baseline command shape:

```sh
./target/release/nose scan bench/repos/<repo> \
  --mode semantic \
  --format json \
  --top 0 \
  --min-size 1
```

The committed corpus checkouts are not part of the repository, so the scan used
the local `bench/repos` corpus from the main worktree. The branch under audit was
`main` at `0b57dd2`.

The audit intentionally used the current pre-#33 JSON contract. That means the
observable facts are limited to `locations[].kind`, source span, language,
family size, scope, and the source shape visible at the reported span. Current
JSON does not say whether a `Block` is a return fragment, guarded exit, ordered
effect sequence, foreach effect, Java self-field body, or proof-only fragment.
Because true semantic fragment shape is not observable before #33, this audit
uses source shape plus location-kind distribution as the numeric proxy for shape.

## Corpus Sweep

The sample covered 28 repositories and 7,607 supported files.

| language | files |
|---|---:|
| c | 2102 |
| ruby | 2033 |
| java | 1136 |
| python | 584 |
| typescript | 522 |
| javascript | 457 |
| rust | 397 |
| go | 376 |

The scan emitted 1,116 semantic families and 3,692 locations. `Block` dominated
the observable output:

| location kind | locations |
|---|---:|
| Block | 2743 |
| Method | 474 |
| Function | 443 |
| Class | 32 |

815 of 1,116 families were all-`Block` families. 709 families had mean span
length at or below three source lines. This reproduces the product concern: the
exact fragment substrate is real and broad, but most observable fragment output
is too small to be treated as a top-level refactoring candidate by default.

## Taxonomy

### Refactor-worthy

The family is likely useful as a direct extraction, shared helper, codegen
target, or intentionally shared implementation. These should be eligible for
default output when they are not generated, vendored, fixture-only, or fully
contained by a better parent finding.

### Review-hazard

The family is useful because repeated logic in larger units can drift, even when
it is not a clean extraction. These should feed `review output`: `nose review`,
hazard-oriented ranking from #23, PR comments, and grouped context around changed
lines.

### Proof-only/noise

The family is exact, but a human is unlikely to act on it as a top-level finding:
one-line guards, one-line asserts, fixture input/output pairs, tiny boilerplate,
or ordinary test setup. These should be hidden by default, grouped under a larger
finding, or shown only in diagnostic/audit views.

### Unsupported/ambiguous

The family looks interesting, but current JSON cannot explain the proof boundary
well enough for product output. These need #33 metadata before they are trusted
outside debug or audit views, especially when the source includes receiver
effects, pointer/index mutation, Java implicit field writes, string-heavy
locale bodies, temp chains, or effect ordering.

## Representative Examples

The table records representative families. Paths are relative to the scanned
repo. `context/action` states what a maintainer would likely do. Whole
`Function`, `Method`, and `Class` rows use the reported span as the enclosing
unit span. For important `Block` rows, the surrounding source was inspected
manually because current JSON does not serialize parent units:

| fragment evidence | inspected enclosing context |
|---|---|
| `gorm:tests/migrate_test.go:250-269` and `337-356` | `TestSmartMigrateColumn` around `185-270`; `TestSmartMigrateColumnGaussDB` around `272-357` |
| `gorm:callbacks/create.go:18-23` and `callbacks/update.go:36-41` | `BeforeCreate` `15-34`; `BeforeUpdate` `33-53` |

| `nginx:src/http/modules/ngx_http_upstream_hash_module.c:398-412` and `src/stream/ngx_stream_upstream_hash_module.c:380-394` | `ngx_http_upstream_update_chash` `336-466`; `ngx_stream_upstream_update_chash` `317-448` |
| `sqlite:ext/fts3/fts3_hash.c:173-184` and `src/hash.c:92-103` | hash insertion helpers around `166-187` and `79-104` |

| `zod:packages/zod/src/v4/classic/schemas.ts:2677-2685` and `mini/schemas.ts:1829-1837` | `instanceof` schema factory around `2665-2688`; mini factory around `1823-1840` |
| `axios:tests/unit/prototypePollution.test.js:882-887` and `896-901` | adjacent test callbacks inside `describe('Prototype Pollution Protection')` `13-1217` |
| `flask:examples/tutorial/tests/test_auth.py:65` and `test_blog.py:11` | `test_logout` `64-69`; `test_index` `6-17` |
| `zod:packages/zod/src/v4/locales/fr-CA.ts:57-108` and `fr.ts:77-124` | locale `error` closures `5-110` and `5-126` |
| `libuv:src/win/fs.c:894-898` and `1102-1106` | `fs__read` `846-929`; `fs__write` `1056-1131` |
| `sqlite:ext/fts3/fts3_hash.c:254-258` and `src/hash.c:193-197` | hash removal helpers around `249-280` and `188-216` |

One-line proof-only rows that are not listed here intentionally omit enclosing
spans: their actionability decision comes from their one-line guard/assert/setup
shape plus path role, not from a specific parent size. They are exactly the cases
that need future `enclosing_unit` metadata if they ever move out of debug output.

## Ranking And Grouping Recommendations

1. Separate exactness from actionability.

   The report should explain two different facts: why the fragment is an exact
   semantic match, and why it is worth a human's attention. Exact proof alone
   must not imply refactorability.

2. Prefer enclosing units over child fragments in default output.

   If a method/function/class family contains smaller exact fragments with the
   same member set or overlapping spans, the default list should show the best
   enclosing candidate once. Child fragments can appear as evidence under the
   parent or in a debug view.

3. Default output should favor refactor-worthy families.

   Default `nose scan` human/json/SARIF output should include whole-unit
   families and larger block fragments when they have enough span, spread,
   non-fixture scope, and a stable explanation. Small fragments may still appear
   when they have high family cardinality and clear extraction shape, but the
   burden should be higher than for functions or methods.

4. Review output should favor synchronization hazards.

   `nose review` and #23-style ranking should show smaller guards, effect
   fragments, overload siblings, cross-language ports, production/test copies,
   and parallel module copies when the changed lines overlap or neighbor the
   fragment. The output must show enclosing context because a one- or two-line
   fragment only becomes meaningful inside the surrounding function.

5. Hidden/debug output should keep proof-only evidence available.

   One-line guards/asserts, formatter fixture input/output, generated-looking
   locale data, and extremely common boilerplate should be hidden by default or
   grouped below an enclosing finding. They remain valuable for validating #33
   fragment extraction and for audits.

6. Effect-bearing fragments need stronger explanation before promotion.

   Blocks with field writes, pointer writes, index assignment, receiver method
   calls, temp chains, and ordered effect sequences should not be promoted from
   debug to default output unless the stable `fragment_kind` / `reason_code`
   metadata and any future diagnostics can explain receiver/place/effect
   identity clearly enough for users.

7. Group by role, not only by fingerprint.

   The product grouping key should consider enclosing unit, path role, scope,
   language, and source shape. Examples: HTTP/stream module siblings, primitive
   overload families, classic/mini package variants, prod/test copies, and
   fixture input/output pairs should be explainable as distinct roles even when
   the exact fingerprint matches.

## Stable Fragment Product Metadata

The product scan JSON now separates stable public fields from diagnostic facts.
`proof_facts` are deliberately not public scan JSON; they remain internal unless
a future diagnostics namespace explicitly documents them as unstable.

### Stable Public Fields

- `is_fragment`: whether the location is a sub-function fragment rather than a
  whole function/method/class. It is serialized for every location.
- `fragment_kind`: stable exact-fragment proof shape, such as direct return,
  direct throw, conditional guard, loop effect, index assignment effect,
  expression effect, or Java self-field body.
- `reason_code`: stable exact-fragment proof reason derived from
  `fragment_kind`, for example `exact-direct-return` or
  `exact-conditional-guard`. This answers why the fragment was accepted as
  exact-safe; it is not the broader actionability vocabulary from #11.
- `enclosing_unit`: kind, name when available, file, start line, end line, and a
  stable unit key. This is required for review-hazard output and for grouping
  child fragments under parent findings.
- `span_lines` and `span_tokens`: explicit span size without consumers
  recalculating from locations.
- family-level `members`, `scope`, module/file spread, and path role:
  production, test, fixture/golden, generated/vendor when known, mixed
  prod/test, and module spread.
- `recommended_surface`: a ranking-time result, not detector semantics:
  default, review, hidden, or debug.

Future #11 family/actionability reason codes should live in a separate family
field. They answer why a family is worth refactoring or reviewing, and must not
share a field with exact-fragment proof reasons.

### Diagnostic Fields

- `proof_facts`: internal explanation ingredients, such as exact-safe subtree
  containment, receiver identity, place identity, effect sink, effect order,
  callee identity, branch-local temporary chain, static import/projection,
  byte/index contract, and Java `this` receiver proof.
- `proof_fact_version`: only needed if diagnostic fields are serialized for
  tooling experiments.
- `fragment_parent`: whether this fragment is contained by another reported
  semantic family, so default output can suppress duplicate child findings.
- `source_shape`: a best-effort observed shape for audits, not a semantic
  contract.

## Output Surface Recommendation

| bucket | default output | review output | hidden/debug output |
|---|---|---|---|
| refactor-worthy | yes, unless contained by a better parent or fixture-only | yes | optional detail |
| review-hazard | only when span/spread is strong enough for standalone attention | yes | optional detail |
| proof-only/noise | no | only when directly changed and grouped under context | yes |
| unsupported/ambiguous | no unless stable metadata explains the proof | yes when stable metadata gives enough context for changed regions | yes |

The current product implementation keeps exact fragments visible in full
machine-readable output while using `recommended_surface` and default ranking
damping so tiny proof fragments do not read as first-class refactoring
candidates. The important product decision remains: exact semantic fragments
are evidence, not automatically refactoring candidates.
