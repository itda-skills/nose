# The verify oracle's value model — scope, gaps, and the extension plan

Design / go-no-go document for closing the three remaining sub-findings of the
P0 false-merge cluster ([#283](https://github.com/corca-ai/nose/issues/283) C,
D-div, D-int32). It scopes *what the oracle's value model is today*, *what each
finding actually needs* (which is **not** one shared "extend i64" prerequisite),
the **minimum** change per finding, the **recall-pricing protocol**, the
**regression targets**, and a **go/no-go** recommendation.

Companion to [design §1 (the sound core is the moat)](design.md),
[formal-soundness](formal-soundness.md), [normalization](normalization.md), the
[fragment behavior oracle](fragment-contracts.md), and the
[adversarial co-evolution runbook](adversarial-coevolution.md). The series-5
finding that opened #283 is [experiments §CE](experiments.md).

## 1. What the value model is today

The offline interpreter oracle (`nose verify`, a differential-testing harness —
**not** a runtime accept gate; see [design §1](design.md)) interprets each unit
on a battery of inputs and compares observable behavior. Its value type is
`Value` (`crates/nose-normalize/src/interp.rs`):

| kind | models | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Int(i64)` | every integer | **all numbers** — there is no float (see §3.3) |
| `Bool(bool)` | booleans | |
| `Str(Vec<u64>)` | strings as a **free monoid** over appended token hashes | **order-sensitive**: `"x"+"y"` = `[hx,hy]` ≠ `[hy,hx]` = `"y"+"x"`. No char content; length/index stay `Err`. |
| `List(Vec<Value>)` | sequences | |
| `Null` | null/none | |
| `Err` | a runtime error | itself observable — two programs must err on the same inputs |
| `Sym` | a symbolic value (opaque call / unproven read / any composition over one) | a differential convention; branching on a `Sym` bails the unit, and a `Sym`-containing behavior never feeds the hard SOUND gate |

Two facts matter for everything below:

- **Strings are already order-sensitive.** The free-monoid `Str` was built
  precisely so that an unsound commutative treatment of `+` on strings is
  *witnessable* — the model is not the gap for finding C.
- **There is no `Float`.** Every numeric literal and result is an `i64`. Float
  *literals* are kept distinct in the value graph (`LitFloat`, a hash of the
  source text, so `3.14 ≠ 2.71` — `crates/nose-il/src/node.rs`), but the
  interpreter has no float arithmetic, so any *computation* whose result depends
  on float semantics is invisible to the oracle.

### 1.1 The input battery (the other half of the oracle)

A bounded differential checker is only as strong as the inputs it feeds. The
production battery is `verify_battery` / `verify_probes`
(`crates/nose-cli/src/main.rs`):

- **Combinatorial core** — a fixed `pool` of **small integers and integer
  lists** (`3, 0, -1, 7, 2`, `[1,2,3,4]`, `[5,1,4,2,8]`, `[]`), enumerated
  mixed-radix over a width-4 row so a 2-arg function's first two slots see
  `a<b`, `a>b`, `a==b`. **The pool contains no strings and no floats.**
- **Literal probes** — the top-16 string-literal hashes and top-16 integers the
  corpus actually branches on, each injected at **one** position with the other
  slots filled by `pool[0]` (the list `[1,2,3,4]`).

The `wide` ("leap-3") battery widens the integer/list domain but follows the same
shape: still no strings in the combinatorial core, still one-position string
probes.

**Consequence:** the battery never binds **two distinct strings to two
parameters simultaneously**. So `f(a,b)=a+b` and `g(a,b)=b+a` are only ever
compared on integer/list rows (where `+` is commutative or both `Err`) and on
single-string probe rows (`"x" + [1,2,3,4]` → `Err`, same as the swap) — never on
`("x","y")`, the one input on which they differ. The order-sensitive `Str` model
is present but **starved of the input that would exercise it**.

---

## 2. The three findings, re-scoped

### C — untyped `+` commutativity / associativity *(detector gate shipped; oracle coverage gap remains)*

Historically, `a+b ≡ b+a` and `(a+b)+c ≡ a+(b+c)` merged for untyped params. That
is wrong for strings (`"x"+"y" ≠ "y"+"x"`), for JS/Java-style mixed string
coercion (`"a"+2+3` differs from `"a"+(2+3)`), and for floats
(`(1e100+1)-1e100`). The detector now fails closed for this family: in
JS/TS/Vue/Svelte/HTML/Java it only flattens/reorders `+`, rewrites `x-y` to
`x+(-y)`, or distributes `-(x+y)` when every `+` leaf is proven non-concat.
Untyped mixed forms such as `x+4`, `x+(2+3)`, `x-3`, and `-(x+2)` stay split from
numeric-only rewrites.

- **Value model:** sufficient for the pure **string + string** half — the `Str`
  monoid is order-sensitive. The oracle still does not model JS/Java
  numeric-to-string coercion for `string + number`, so mixed-coercion regressions
  rely on external-language witnesses plus detector fingerprint splits until that
  model exists. The **float** half of C overlaps D-div; see there.
- **Remaining gap:** the **battery** (§1.1) never feeds two distinct strings/lists
  to two params at once, and it has no mixed string/number coercion rows. The
  detector no longer merges the known C string/mixed cases, but `nose verify`
  remains too weak to witness all of them by itself.
- **Cheapest of the three.** The detector floor is in place; the remaining work
  is oracle coverage/modeling plus recall pricing on larger corpora.

### D-int32 — JS bitwise width *(detector floor shipped; oracle width gap remains)*

JS bitwise ops coerce operands to int32 (`ToInt32`); Python/Ruby are
arbitrary-precision. Historically the detector merged JS `a&b` with Python
`a&b` (same `Bin(BitAnd,[a,b])` fingerprint) and the oracle read SOUND (both
modeled as i64 `x & y`). They differ for operands outside int32 range (`2^40 &
2^40` → JS `0`, Python `2^40`).

- **Value kind:** none new — int32 is representable inside `Int(i64)` via
  `x as i32 as i64`.
- **Detector floor (shipped):** JS-family bitwise leaves now carry a `ToInt32`
  wrapper in the value graph. That makes JS `& | ^ ~ << >>` fingerprints distinct
  from arbitrary-precision Python/Ruby while preserving within-JS commutativity
  and De Morgan recall (`~(a&b)` still converges with `~a|~b`). `>>>` remains a
  distinct raw/operator surface.
- **Remaining gap:** the independent interpreter still executes bitwise over
  i64, so `nose verify` cannot yet witness the JS-vs-bigint difference by itself.
  A full fixed-width model must thread width through bitwise canon and interpreter
  execution, then price any JS↔C/Java-int recall recovery.

### D-div — true-float division *(fingerprint floor shipped; Float value gap remains)*

Three-way split: `/` is **true-float** in Python 3 / JS (`7/2 == 3.5`),
**floored-int** in Ruby (`7/2 == 3`), **truncated-int** in C/Go/Java/Rust
(`-7/2 == -3`). The integer cases are partly handled (`Op::FloorDiv` exists), but
they are **operand-type-entangled** — Ruby `/` is floored only for integers and
true-float for floats, so even Ruby `/` ≡ Python `//` holds *only on integers*.
The true-float result `3.5` is **unrepresentable in `Int(i64)`**.

- **Value kind:** genuinely needs **`Float`** (plus the float semantics of
  `+ - * / %` and the per-language Int↔Float coercion rules).
- **Detector floor (shipped):** Python and JS `/` now lower to `Op::TrueDiv`,
  Ruby `/` and Python `//` lower to `Op::FloorDiv`, and C-family integer `/`
  remains `Op::Div`. The value graph no longer merges true-float, floored, and
  truncated division.
- **Remaining gap:** the interpreter still maps `TrueDiv` integer inputs through
  i64 truncation internally. That is safe for the detector floor because
  `TrueDiv` has a distinct fingerprint, but it is not a real float model and
  cannot witness `7 / 2 == 3.5` or NaN/±0 behavior.
- **Most expensive.** Float drags in NaN (`NaN != NaN`), `±0`, non-associativity
  (the float half of C), and equality quirks — a large new surface in both the
  interpreter and the canonicalizer.

## 3. Minimum scope per finding — a sound floor, then optionally a full model

Each finding has a **fail-closed floor** (sound, cheap, with a measured recall
cost) and a **full model** (recovers the recall, larger surface). Ship the floor
first; promote to the full model only if the priced recall loss justifies it.

### 3.1 C — battery/model enrichment after the detector gate

- **Detector floor (shipped):** gate untyped `+` commute/reorder and related
  add/sub/negation rewrites on a *proven-not-concat* predicate: reorder only when
  every operand is proven numeric/non-string. Untyped `+` stays ordered in
  string-coercive languages, while typed numeric `+` still converges.
- **Oracle coverage:** add battery rows that bind **two distinct strings** (and
  two distinct lists) to multiple positions — e.g. probe pairs `("α","β")` drawn
  from the mined string set, plus a couple of distinct-list rows. Add mixed
  string/number rows only after the interpreter has explicit JS/Java coercion
  semantics. *Effect:* `verify` can witness `a+b ≠ b+a` for strings and later
  `"a"+2+3 ≠ "a"+(2+3)` for coercive languages, instead of relying only on
  detector fingerprint splits and external-language witnesses.
- **Cost:** Medium detector gate already paid; remaining Low-Medium oracle
  enrichment/modeling plus recall pricing.

### 3.2 D-int32 — width-aware bitwise canon

- **Floor (shipped):** JS bitwise (`& | ^ ~ << >>`) fingerprints through a
  distinct `ToInt32` narrowing wrapper, so it stops merging with
  arbitrary-precision bitwise. De Morgan and same-language bitwise recall remain
  green because the wrap lands on leaves rather than replacing the whole operator.
- **Full model:** a first-class fixed-width bitwise semantics (int32 for JS,
  type-width for C/Java/Go/Rust) that the whole bitwise canon understands — so
  JS `a&b` ≡ Java-`int` `a&b` ≡ C-`int32_t` `a&b` reconverge correctly while
  staying split from bigint and 64-bit. Largest of the three canon surfaces.
- **Cost:** floor paid; remaining Medium-High for oracle int32 execution and full
  fixed-width recall recovery.

### 3.3 D-div — Float value kind

- **Floor (shipped):** Python/JS `/` (true-float division) fingerprints as
  `TrueDiv`, distinct from C-family truncated `Div` and Ruby/Python `FloorDiv`.
  Same-semantics surfaces still converge (`Python /` with JS `/`, Ruby `/` with
  Python `//`).
- **Subtraction slice (shipped, series-9 follow-up):** a `-` carrying a proven-float
  operand (float literal / `TrueDiv` result / float-typed param) is kept as a literal
  `Sub` instead of being routed through the AC `+` normalization (`a - b` ≡ `a + (-b)`),
  so `(1e100 + x) - 1e100` no longer false-merges with the regrouped `(1e100 - 1e100) + x`
  (`proven_float` + the `eval_sub_chain` gate; corpus family delta 0). This works only
  because `Sub` and `Add` are distinct fingerprint nodes.
- **Why the pure `+`/`*` case still needs the full model (the finding):** gating the
  *canonicalizer* CANNOT close `(a+b)+c ≡ a+(b+c)` for floats — the exact fingerprint
  flattens an associative-commutative chain to its **leaf sequence** (grouping-insensitive
  by design, so loop≡sum and regrouped sums converge), so holding the source tree grouping
  leaves the leaves identical and the fingerprint unchanged. Closing it requires the
  fingerprint itself to be **grouping-sensitive for float chains** — i.e. the Float value
  kind, not a canon gate.
- **Full model:** add `Value::Float` with IEEE-754 semantics, the per-language
  Int↔Float coercion lattice, and the float half of C (`+`/`*` non-associativity,
  `(a+b)+c ≠ a+(b+c)`). Recovers the recall the floor gives up. **Largest single
  piece in the whole #283 cluster** — its own design doc if pursued.
- **Cost:** floor paid; remaining High for a real Float interpreter/value-graph model.

## 4. Recall-pricing protocol

Every change here is a soundness *gain* paid for in *recall*. None ships without
the price measured, on both the dev split and a heldout split, using the tooling
already in the loop ([design §4b coverage loop](design.md),
[experiments](experiments.md) pricing methodology,
[adversarial co-evolution runbook](adversarial-coevolution.md) accept-distribution
pre-gate).

For each candidate fix, record **before → after**:

1. **Soundness (must improve or hold).**
   `nose verify bench/repos` → `SOUND: no false merges ✓`, and the reproducer in
   §5 must flip from merged to split. Canon-preservation violations must not rise
   above the standing baseline (currently **20**, sympy/nushell).
2. **Recall delta (the price).**
   `nose scan bench/repos --mode semantic --top 0` family count, **dev split and
   heldout split separately**. A change that holds family count on dev but drops
   it on heldout is over-fit; a change that holds both at ~0 cost (as
   [#283-B](https://github.com/corca-ai/nose/issues/283) did: 4294 → 4294) is a
   free soundness win. Report the absolute family delta and the specific families
   lost, not just a percentage.
3. **Accept-distribution pre-gate.**
   Before trusting the family delta, confirm the accept distribution didn't shift
   pathologically (a fix that merges *nothing* trivially has "no false merges");
   the pre-gate guards against measuring a degenerate detector.
4. **No silent regressions elsewhere.**
   dup-gate (`scripts/check-duplication.sh`, budget 28) and the byte-identical
   `cmp` fingerprint-stability gate must stay green; build a `main` worktree
   baseline for the family count so the delta is apples-to-apples (see the perf
   tooling notes in the repo memory / [dogfooding](dogfooding.md)).

A fix is **GO** only when soundness improves, the reproducer flips, and the recall
price (dev **and** heldout) is either ~0 or an explicitly accepted trade.

---

## 5. Regression targets

The confirmed reproducers live in `bench/coevo/false_merges/` (kept until #283
fully closes; the fixed rows are already covered by permanent tests). Each fix
must move its target from "merged + oracle-blind/silent" to "split (or
oracle-caught)":

| target | file / repro | must become |
|---|---|---|
| C — string/mixed-coercive `+` ordering | `untyped_add_commute.py` (`a+b` vs `b+a`) and JS/TS/Java-style `x+4` / `x+(2+3)` / `x-3` / `-(x+2)` | detector keeps them **split**; oracle witnesses pure string now only after battery enrichment, and mixed string/number after coercion modeling |
| C — float `+` non-associativity | `float_assoc.py` (`(a+b)+c` vs `a+(b+c)`) | oracle witnesses (needs §3.3 float) or detector keeps split |
| D-int32 — JS bitwise vs bigint | cross-language `a & b` (JS vs Python), e.g. the §2 reproducer | detector keeps **split**; oracle int32 execution remains follow-up |
| D-div — true-float `/` | Python/JS `a/b` vs Ruby `a/b` vs C `a/b` | the three **do not merge**; real Float oracle remains follow-up |

New permanent regression tests follow the pattern of
`crates/nose-cli/tests/equivalence.rs`
(`double_negation_cancels_only_for_proven_numeric` etc.): assert the
`value_fp` of the divergent forms differs, and that the genuine convergent case
still merges.

---

## 6. Go / no-go recommendation

The findings are **decoupled** — there is no forced ordering and no shared
foundational blocker (the original "extend the value model" framing was too
coarse). Recommended sequence, cheapest-and-highest-confidence first:

1. **C (battery + `+`-gate) — GO first.** The value model already supports it;
   the only new code is battery rows plus a `proven_numeric`-style gate we have a
   proven template for. Highest soundness-per-effort. The battery enrichment
   alone (the floor) is worth shipping immediately — it strengthens the oracle for
   *every* future finding and tells us how big the untyped-`+` problem actually
   is before we price the gate.
2. **D-int32 — floor shipped; defer the full width model.** The distinct
   narrowing fingerprint is in place. Next work is int32 oracle execution plus
   measured JS↔C/Java-int recall recovery. Promote to the full fixed-width canon
   only if that loss is material.
3. **D-div (Float) — floor shipped; full model remains NO-GO for now.** The
   true/floored/truncated fingerprints are split. The full `Value::Float` model
   is the largest single surface in the cluster and should not be started until
   (a) the floor's recall price proves it necessary and (b) it gets its own
   design doc covering NaN/±0/coercion.

This converts "one big scary foundational extension" into **three independently
priced, independently shippable fixes**, each with a sound floor — exactly the
incremental, measured discipline [design §1](design.md) and the
[co-evolution runbook](adversarial-coevolution.md) call for.

## 7. Why the battery is not broadened by naive enumeration (#317)

#317 proposed replacing the hand-curated input battery (`verify_battery`) with an
*enumerative* distinguishing-input search. The naive form — feed more value kinds
(equal strings, bool, null) at more positions — is **unsound**, and the reason is
worth recording so it is not re-attempted:

The battery is global and positional: row `[a,b,c,d]` is bound to params 0–3 of
*every* unit, regardless of each param's type. A unit's param carries a coercion only
when it has **declared domain evidence** (`coerce_to_declared_domain`, interp.rs);
typed-language array/index params (Java `byte[] bytes`, `int startPos`,
`String[] a`) carry **none** today, so an incoherent value reaches them uncoerced.
Feeding, say, a string or a list to a slot a unit uses as an array index manufactures
an input that **can never occur**, and on it the *interpreter*, not the canonicalizer,
diverged — producing a spurious **canon-preservation** violation (the check is
concrete-only but does not filter `Err`).

This is not hypothetical, and not new to broadening: the *current* battery already
trips it. `nose verify` on `netty` reported 3 canon-preservation "violations", all on
type-incoherent rows, and `sympy` 20 — masked only because the nightly soundness gate's
pinned corpus includes neither.

### 7.1 The equality-over-`Err` mechanism — fixed (coevo series 9)

The series-9 oracle attacker sharpened the dominant class: the trigger was the
**`==`/`!=` canon meeting an `Err` operand**, and it was **language-independent**
(untyped Python `def f(b,s): return b[s]==0` reproduced the typed-Java `bytes[i] != 0`).
The root was an **interpreter asymmetry**, not a canon bug: `eval_bin_op` short-circuited
`Err` on the *left* operand only, and `bin`'s comparison fallthrough read `0 == Err` as a
concrete `Bool(false)` (and `!=` as `Bool(true)`). So the moment the sound `==`/`!=`
operand-ordering canon (algebra sorts commutative comparison operands by hash) moved the
erroring operand to the right, the full IL returned a `Bool` while the pre-canon core
returned `Err` — a spurious violation. **Fix: `bin` propagates `Err` from *either*
operand** (the symmetric twin of `un`'s existing `(Op::Not, Err) => Err`); the left
short-circuit stays for laziness/effect order. This is pure interpreter fidelity —
`interp.rs` is verify-only, so scan output is byte-identical — and it closes the class
wherever it arises: **sympy 20 → 2 canon violations, netty 3 → 2**, every other checked
repo unchanged at 0, zero false merges throughout.

### 7.2 The remaining violations were real dataflow bugs — fixed (coevo series 9)

The two narrower sub-classes that survived §7.1 turned out NOT to be spurious: the
canon-preservation check was correctly catching the copy-propagation inliner
(`dataflow.rs`) make **real-semantics-unsound** moves, surfaced via type-incoherent rows
only because the value model doesn't track in-place mutation (§7.3).

- **Inline past a clobbering indexed write** (netty/guava `swap`/`swapElements`/
  `ObjectArrays`): `t = a[i]; a[i] = a[j]; a[j] = t` was inlined to `a[i] = a[j]; a[j] =
  a[i]` — reading the *already-overwritten* `a[i]`, turning a swap into "set both to
  `a[j]`". The inliner's hazard check missed it because `collect_writes` only recorded
  `Var` assignments, not that an indexed store `a[i] = …` MUTATES the base `a`.
- **Inline into a lambda body** (sympy `_matches_get_other_nodes` /
  `unit_propagate_int_repr`): `ind = nodes[k]` (a possibly-raising read) was inlined into
  a comprehension filter — evaluated zero times on an empty iterable, eliding the `Err`
  the eager read raises. The inliner mapped the lambda-internal use to its top-level
  statement and saw it as "a later statement of the same block."

**Fix:** `collect_writes` records the root var of an `Index`/`Field` store target as a
write (so the hazard check blocks the swap inline), and the inliner skips any use in a
CONDITIONAL/REPEATED position — a lambda body, an `If` branch, or under a `Loop` — so it
never moves a read into a context evaluated under a different condition. Both are
real-semantics soundness fixes; the value-graph FINGERPRINT is essentially unchanged (the
value graph does its own env substitution, corpus family delta ≈ 0) and the soundness
oracle stays clean. Canon-preservation violations are now **zero** across netty/sympy/guava
and the wider sweep — together with `bin`'s symmetric `Err` (§7.1), every
canon-preservation violation the corpus surfaced is closed.

### 7.3 The deeper limit: in-place element mutation is not modeled (oracle-blind, OPEN)

The value model treats an indexed/collection store `a[i] = v` as an ordered, opaque effect
and does NOT update readable state — so a later `a[i]` read re-derives the *pre-write*
value (`field` stores ARE versioned via `field_env`; array elements are not). Under that
model `swap` (`t=a[i]; a[i]=a[j]; a[j]=t`) and `clobber` (`a[i]=a[j]; a[j]=a[i]`) compute
the same effect trace, so they share an `exact-value-graph` fingerprint — a latent false
merge. It is **oracle-blind**: the interpreter shares the same no-mutation model, so the
false-merge check sees them as behavior-equal too (no battery row distinguishes them). This
is the same category as float non-associativity (`bench/coevo/false_merges/float_assoc.py`):
a known value-model gap the oracle cannot witness, not a regression. Closing it needs
in-place element-mutation modeling (version `a[i]` reads by the array's write state) in
BOTH the value graph and the interpreter — a value-model extension on the scale of the
`Float` kind (§3.3), tracked separately. Until then it is recorded in
`bench/coevo/false_merges/` as an OPEN, oracle-blind class.

**Net:** the equality-over-`Err` class (§7.1) and the dataflow unsoundness (§7.2) are
closed, so the verify soundness gate can widen toward dynamic-language repos. The
array-mutation modeling gap (§7.3) and type-domain-aware input feeding remain the
floor-then-model follow-ups (§3); `verify_battery`'s Part 3 stays hand-curated **on
purpose** (a guard comment there points here).
