# Recall-loss diagnostics

`nose verify --recall-loss-report <file>` writes a local JSON report for the
strictness/recall tradeoff in exact semantic matching. It is a diagnostics
artifact, not telemetry: nose does not send it anywhere, and raw source snippets
are omitted by default.

Use this report when a semantic-kernel or semantic-pack change touches exact
admission. The hard rule stays unchanged: stricter admission must not introduce
false merges. The report adds the missing second question: if exact admission got
stricter, what recall did it close and which capability or evidence gap explains
that loss?

## Command

```sh
nose verify <path> --max-violations 0 --recall-loss-report recall-loss.json
```

The command reuses the same interpreter oracle as `nose verify`. The human
stdout remains the existing soundness/completeness report; the JSON artifact is
written only to the requested path.

Compare two local reports with:

```sh
python3 scripts/recall-loss-diff.py before.json after.json
```

The comparison is deterministic and suitable for PR comments: it shows hard gate
deltas, completeness and under-merge deltas, oracle exclusion deltas, admission
rejection deltas by reason, and top opportunities added or removed.

## Report shape

The current schema is `recall_loss_report.v1.json`:

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `schema_version` | Report schema version. Starts at `1`. |
| `privacy` | Local-artifact flags. `remote_collection` is `false`; `raw_source_snippets_included` is `false` by default. |
| `summary` | Total units, interpretable units, excluded units, canon checks, and exact-admission rejection count. |
| `soundness_gate` | Fingerprint groups, false merges, advisory disagreements, canon-preservation violations, `--max-violations`, and gate result. |
| `completeness` | Behavior groups, behavior-equal pairs, fingerprint-equal pairs, completeness percentage, and under-merged groups. |
| `oracle_under_merges` | Behavior-equal but fingerprint-split pairs, sorted by value-Jaccard nearness. This is the structured form of the `--leads` signal. |
| `oracle_exclusions` | Fail-closed oracle exclusions by reason and unit location. |
| `import_snapshot_census` | Corpus-level imported immutable snapshot diagnostics: successful snapshot record counts, unresolved binding-import miss counts by reason/language, and stable hash/location rows for follow-up fixtures. |
| `admission_rejections` | Interpretable units whose exact semantic claim is closed, with structured reason, gate, capability, missing evidence, #594 obligation family/subreason, oracle status, and stable location. |
| `by_reason` | Rollups for admission rejections by reason/gate/capability. |
| `by_obligation` | Rollups for admission rejections by #594 obligation family and stable subreason. |
| `top_opportunities` | Ranked under-merge opportunities that future capability work can turn into fixtures or focused follow-up issues. |

The current admission-rejection taxonomy is diagnostics-only; it does not widen
or narrow product admission by itself.

| reason | meaning |
|---|---|
| `import-symbol-callee-identity-proof-missing` | An ordinary call is interpretable, but exact admission lacks reusable proof of the callee/import/symbol target. |
| `receiver-domain-proof-missing` | A receiver method call needs receiver-domain evidence rather than selector-name inference. |
| `library-api-occurrence-proof-missing` | A canonical builtin/API occurrence lacks admitted pack or producer evidence. |
| `hof-demand-effect-proof-missing` | A higher-order surface lacks a demand, effect, and materialization profile. |
| `source-surface-proof-missing` | A source construct, operator, comprehension, Rust macro invocation, or syntax distinction is required but not proven. |
| `mutation-effect-boundary` | Mutation, place, side-effecting call, or effect obligations close exact admission until an effect-preserving contract exists. |
| `unsupported-runtime-boundary` | Runtime/protocol boundaries such as raw lowered constructs, try/throw, splat, or keyword-argument surfaces intentionally fail closed. |
| `value-fingerprint-too-small` | The unit is strict-exact-safe, but its value fingerprint is below the non-degenerate exact-claim floor. |
| `unattributed-strict-exact-unsafe` | Fallback for unknown strict-exact rejection. This should stay visible and should trend toward zero. |

Unknown cases must remain explicit as `unattributed-strict-exact-unsafe`; do not
guess.

Each admission rejection also carries an `obligation_family` and
`obligation_subreason`. These fields are diagnostics-only and refine broad
reason buckets into the cross-language vocabulary from [scheduling-channel-callback-obligations-594](scheduling-channel-callback-obligations-594.md).
They do not change exact admission.

| obligation family | typical subreason | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `callback-demand-effect` | `callback-member-call-effect-proof-missing`, `callback-rust-macro-call-effect-proof-missing`, `callback-direct-function-call-effect-contract-missing`, `callback-imported-function-call-effect-contract-missing`, `callback-assignment-effect-proof-missing`, `callback-runtime-boundary-proof-missing`, `callback-identity-or-shape-proof-missing`, `promise-then-callback-demand-effect-contract-missing`, `mapping-callback-demand-effect-profile-missing`, `predicate-callback-demand-effect-profile-missing`, `flattening-callback-demand-effect-profile-missing`, `optional-callback-demand-effect-profile-missing`, or `reduction-callback-demand-effect-profile-missing` | A HOF/callback surface lacks timing, callback identity, effect visibility, result role, call-shape proof, or materialization proof. |
| `executor-callback` | `promise-executor-callback-effect-contract-missing` | A Promise/Future-like constructor callback needs executor timing, thrown-to-rejected outcome, and callback-effect proof before exact use. |
| `receiver-mutation` | `effect-preserving-contract-missing` | A mutation/place/effect boundary blocks exact admission. |
| `rejection-channel` | `promise-reject-rejected-value-channel-contract-missing`, `promise-catch-rejection-continuation-contract-missing`, `promise-finally-settlement-continuation-contract-missing`, `promise-then-rejection-continuation-contract-missing`, legacy `promise-rejection-channel-contract-missing`/`promise-rejection-continuation-contract-missing`, or `exception-channel-contract-missing` | Rejection, catch/finally settlement, throw, rescue, or non-local error flow must remain distinct from ordinary return values. |
| `success-error-result-channel` | `promise-factory-settled-value-contract-missing`, `promise-aggregate-result-channel-contract-missing`, or `promise-then-fulfillment-continuation-contract-missing` | Success, empty/default, error/rejection, and aggregate result channels need explicit result-shape proof. |
| `scheduling-boundary` | `promise-await-scheduling-contract-missing`, `promise-async-function-scheduling-contract-missing`, `promise-non-construct-call-boundary-contract-missing`, or `runtime-protocol-boundary-contract-missing` | A lowered runtime/protocol construct needs scheduling or protocol semantics before exact use. |
| `channel-boundary` | `channel-protocol-contract-missing` | Channel send/receive/select semantics need protocol evidence before exact use. |
| `exception-channel` | `exception-channel-contract-missing` | Try/throw/error propagation is an explicit channel boundary, not a scheduling boundary. |
| `ambiguous-selector-boundary` | `receiver-domain-proof-missing`, `promise-then-promise-like-receiver-proof-missing`, `library-api-occurrence-evidence-missing`, or a call-target proof label | Selector, receiver, library API, or callee identity proof is missing. |
| `source-protocol-boundary` | `source-surface-contract-missing`, `rust-macro-expansion-contract-missing` | A source/protocol syntax distinction is required but not proven. |
| `non-degenerate-fingerprint-floor` | `non-degenerate-value-fingerprint` | The unit is otherwise exact-safe but too small for a non-degenerate exact claim. |
| `unattributed-boundary` | `strict-exact-safe-tree-missing` | A strict-exact rejection still lacks a more specific capability attribution. |

The checked-in baseline summaries and the five-cycle recovery log are described
in [recall-loss-recovery-loop](recall-loss-recovery-loop.md).
The #572 cycle also records a diagnostics-only refinement: expression-statement
calls that need an effect contract stay in the effect boundary bucket, and
unmodeled Rust macros such as `format!` stay in the source-surface bucket until
a macro expansion or library contract proves their behavior.
The #574 cycle keeps the same `import-symbol-callee-identity-proof-missing`
reason but splits its `missing_evidence` labels by call-target surface, such as
`local-or-parameter-call-target-proof`, `scoped-path-call-target-proof`,
`member-call-target-proof`, imported/global target proof labels, and admitted
target-present call-contract proof labels. Build the checked-in census with
`scripts/recall-loss-callee-census.py`.

The post-#594 callback diagnostics refinement keeps the same
`hof-demand-effect-proof-missing` reason, but HOF rejections now also expose
kind-specific and callback-specific `missing_evidence` labels such as
`hof-map-callback-demand-effect-profile`, `hof-filter-callback-demand-effect-profile`,
`hof-callback-call-effect-proof`, `hof-callback-assignment-effect-proof`,
`hof-callback-runtime-boundary-proof`, and `hof-callback-identity-proof`. The
checked baselines are [callback-demand-effect-diagnostics-2026-06-28.v1.json](../bench/recall_loss/callback-demand-effect-diagnostics-2026-06-28.v1.json)
and [callback-demand-effect-diagnostics-2026-06-28.v2.json](../bench/recall_loss/callback-demand-effect-diagnostics-2026-06-28.v2.json).
The follow-up [callback-demand-effect-diagnostics-2026-06-28.v3.json](../bench/recall_loss/callback-demand-effect-diagnostics-2026-06-28.v3.json)
keeps exact admission closed but splits callback call-effect proof by
producer-facing call shape: member calls (`10`), Rust macro calls (`8`),
direct-function effect contracts (`3`), and imported-function effect contracts
(`1`) on the local `crates` surface.

Promise protocol diagnostics keep exact admission closed while splitting
runtime-boundary evidence by scheduling, executor callback, rejection channel,
and aggregate-result obligations. The checked [promise-protocol diagnostics](../bench/recall_loss/promise-protocol-diagnostics-2026-06-28.v1.json)
connect the JS/TS source-prevalence group (`29,094` Promise/async occurrences)
to report labels such as `promise-await-scheduling-contract`,
`promise-async-function-scheduling-contract`,
`promise-executor-callback-effect-contract`,
`promise-aggregate-result-channel-contract`,
`promise-rejection-channel-contract`, and
`promise-non-construct-call-boundary-contract`.
The follow-up [promise-protocol hard negatives](../bench/recall_loss/promise-protocol-hard-negatives-2026-06-28.v1.json)
keep `semantic_admission_delta = 0` and pin the closed boundaries that must
hold before any Promise recovery slice opens: async-function/sync convergence,
executor or factory/sync convergence, Promise chain/custom receiver
convergence, thenable assimilation, unsupported settled producers, and
aggregate first-settled/result-channel differences.
The first recovery slice is [promise-resolve-recovery-2026-06-28.v1.json](../bench/recall_loss/promise-resolve-recovery-2026-06-28.v1.json).
It opens only dependency-closed `Promise.resolve(value)` factories whose
argument is proven non-thenable-safe, while preserving the same hard negatives
for sync payloads, possible thenables, explicit PromiseLike values, executors,
aggregate channels, and rejection channels.
The reporting-only [promise rejection/continuation diagnostics](../bench/recall_loss/promise-rejection-continuation-diagnostics-2026-06-28.v1.json)
then split the former rejection-channel catch-all into `Promise.reject`
rejected-value channels, `.catch` rejection continuations, and `.finally`
settlement continuations. `.catch` and `.finally` also carry callback
demand/effect labels, but exact Promise continuation admission remains closed.
The follow-up [promise then obligation diagnostics](../bench/recall_loss/promise-then-obligation-diagnostics-2026-06-28.v1.json)
does the same for `.then`: selector-only or custom receivers report
`promise-then-promise-like-receiver-proof`, while fulfillment continuation,
rejection continuation, and callback demand/effect stay visible as distinct
missing-evidence labels.
The checked [promise continuation report-row fixture](../bench/recall_loss/promise-continuation-report-rows-2026-06-28.v1.json)
turns those labels into actual local `admission_rejections`: focused
`.then`, `.catch`, and `.finally` units are all oracle-interpretable, have zero
oracle exclusions, and report three fail-closed Promise continuation rows without
opening exact admission.
The follow-up [promise local continuation recovery](../bench/recall_loss/promise-local-continuation-recovery-2026-06-29.v1.json)
opens a narrow exact slice for first-party local Promise continuations while
preserving the recall-loss vocabulary for everything still closed. It admits
`Promise.reject`, `.catch`, two-argument `.then`, handler-returned
`Promise.resolve` flattening, and `catch`/`then(undefined, onRejected)`
convergence only when the receiver, producer, and callback are dependency-closed.
Custom thenables, `.finally`, aggregate combinators, broad async scheduling, and
sync payload equivalence remain reportable under the existing obligation
buckets.
The reporting follow-ups [promise receiver-producer diagnostics](../bench/recall_loss/promise-receiver-producer-diagnostics-2026-06-29.v1.json)
and [promise call-return callee diagnostics](../bench/recall_loss/promise-call-return-callee-diagnostics-2026-06-29.v1.json)
keep those remaining receivers fail-closed but make the next capability gaps
specific: constructor-created promises, async-function returns, generic
call-return receivers, and then member/local/imported call-return callee shapes
all have named missing-evidence labels. These labels are attribution only; exact
admission still requires explicit callee identity plus returned `PromiseLike`
domain proof.
The [same-file async-function return recovery](../bench/recall_loss/promise-async-function-return-recovery-2026-06-29.v1.json)
slice opens the narrow direct-call case behind that requirement. A direct call to
a source-proven async function now has `PromiseLike` result-domain evidence, and
only pure non-thenable-safe returned payloads feed local `.then` fulfillment
recovery. The report should therefore move those receivers out of
`promise-async-function-return-producer-proof` and leave any still-closed work in
continuation, rejection, callback, or scheduling obligations.
The [direct-function Promise return recovery](../bench/recall_loss/promise-direct-function-return-recovery-2026-06-29.v1.json)
slice opens the next proof-backed direct-call subset: a same-file non-async
single-return function can provide `PromiseLike` result-domain evidence only
when the returned expression already has PromiseLike domain proof. The report
should therefore move those receivers out of
`promise-call-return-direct-function-return-domain-proof` and leave unproven
parameter callees, member/imported call returns, unsafe thenables, constructors,
`.finally`, aggregate channels, and broad scheduling in their existing
fail-closed obligations.
The [direct-method Promise return recovery](../bench/recall_loss/promise-direct-method-return-recovery-2026-06-29.v1.json)
slice opens the proof-backed subset of member call-return receivers: an existing
DirectMethod target record plus returned-expression PromiseLike domain proof can
provide call-result `Domain(PromiseLike)` for non-async single-return methods.
The value graph evaluates only the returned expression and closes on receiver
context, so selector-only member calls, dynamic dispatch, imported members,
receiver-dependent methods, unsafe thenables, constructors, `.finally`,
aggregate channels, and broad scheduling remain in fail-closed obligations.
The [imported Promise call-return boundary](../bench/recall_loss/promise-imported-call-return-boundary-2026-06-29.v1.json)
keeps imported function/member receivers closed but sharpens the report
vocabulary: target-present imported Promise receivers now require a
settled-value contract rather than mere return-domain proof. Imported
call-target evidence proves a module/export/member coordinate, not a local body
whose fulfilled or rejected payload can be evaluated.

`import_snapshot_census` is also diagnostics-only. It does not make an imported
value exact-safe. It records why a proven binding import did not become an
imported immutable snapshot after corpus import resolution. Current miss reasons
include:

| reason | meaning |
|---|---|
| `provider-module-missing` | The imported module hash has no provider file in the analyzed corpus. |
| `provider-export-missing` | A provider module exists, but no matching exported binding was found. |
| `provider-export-ambiguous` | More than one provider binding could own the same module/export coordinate. |
| `provider-external-crate-boundary` | The import targets a known external crate dependency, which is outside same-corpus provider lookup. |
| `provider-reexport-ambiguous` | More than one direct public re-export could own the requested module/export coordinate. |
| `provider-reexport-callable-boundary` | A direct public re-export resolves to a callable item, not an immutable literal provider value. |
| `provider-reexport-type-boundary` | A direct public re-export resolves to a type item, not an immutable literal provider value. |
| `provider-reexport-module-namespace-boundary` | A direct public re-export resolves to a module namespace, not an immutable literal provider value. |
| `provider-reexport-external-crate-boundary` | A direct public re-export target resolves to a known external crate boundary. |
| `provider-reexport-target-export-missing` | A direct public re-export exists, but its target module has no matching export in the analyzed corpus. |
| `provider-reexport-target-module-missing` | A direct public re-export exists, but its target module is not resolved in the analyzed corpus. |
| `cross-language-boundary` | A same-coordinate provider exists only in a different lowered language. |
| `self-import-boundary` | The only matching provider is the importer file itself. |
| `importer-binding-mutated` | The importer mutates the imported binding before it could be snapshotted. |
| `provider-binding-unsafe` | The provider binding is mutated or escapes through an opaque call argument. |
| `provider-library-api-proof-missing` | The provider RHS is a factory call without admitted `LibraryApi` proof. |
| `provider-factory-arguments-not-exact-safe` | The provider factory is proven, but its arguments are not export-safe. |
| `provider-aggregate-children-not-exact-safe` | The provider aggregate has a surface proof, but its children are not export-safe imported literal values. |
| `provider-sequence-surface-not-import-literal-safe` | The provider aggregate has a proven sequence surface, but that surface is not an imported-literal value surface. |
| `provider-aggregate-child-reference-boundary` | The provider aggregate contains a child reference, field path, or index expression rather than a literal/export-safe value. |
| `provider-aggregate-child-import-coordinate-boundary` | The provider aggregate contains an import-coordinate placeholder; coordinates are proof, not imported literal values. |
| `provider-aggregate-child-surface-not-exact-safe` | A nested provider aggregate child has a sequence surface that is not exact-tree-safe. |
| `provider-aggregate-child-call-boundary` | A provider aggregate child is a call expression without a supported imported-literal child contract. |
| `provider-sequence-surface-proof-missing` | The provider aggregate lacks the sequence-surface proof required for imported literal export. |
| `unsupported-provider-rhs-shape` | The provider RHS is not a literal, supported aggregate, or supported factory call. |

The #567 import-backed immutable provenance closeout is the reference example
for using this census to end a capability slice without widening admission. See [import-backed immutable provenance closeout](import-backed-immutable-provenance-closeout-567.md)
and the checked-in [closeout artifact](../bench/recall_loss/issue-567-closeout.v1.json).

## PR reporting

For any PR that changes exact semantic admission, include this table or the same
fields in prose:

| metric | before | after | note |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| false merges |  |  | Hard gate: must stay `0` on the selected verification surface. |
| canon-preservation violations |  |  | Hard gate: must stay `0`. |
| completeness percentage |  |  | Soft signal: explain meaningful movement. |
| under-merged behavior groups |  |  | Soft signal: increased misses need attribution. |
| oracle exclusions by reason |  |  | Soft signal: budget/path/uninterpretable growth needs a cause. |
| admission rejections by structured reason |  |  | Main recall-loss signal. |
| import snapshot misses by reason |  |  | Process signal for deciding the next imported-value capability slice. |
| top attributed recall-loss bucket |  |  | Name the follow-up capability, fixture, or unsupported boundary. |

Use `scripts/recall-loss-diff.py before.json after.json` for the before/after
table when both full local reports are available.

Hard gate:

- `false_merges == 0`;
- `canon_preservation_violations == 0`.

Soft regression gate:

- any increase in under-merged groups, oracle exclusions, or admission rejections
  should be attributed to a structured reason bucket;
- intentional fail-closed recall loss should name a follow-up capability,
  fixture, or unsupported boundary;
- recall gains should state which strict evidence or capability made them safe.
