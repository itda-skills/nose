# Semantic kernel snapshot

Back to [semantic-kernel](semantic-kernel.md). This page records the current
implementation shape; planned work and decision history live in
[semantic-kernel-roadmap](semantic-kernel-roadmap.md). The internal evidence
record substrate is described in [evidence-records](evidence-records.md).

Snapshot date: 2026-06-08. The current implementation has an internal
semantic-kernel facade, receiver-aware field state, sequence-surface contracts,
proof-backed append fragment evidence, operator-law contracts, typed import
facts, source-fact gates for construct/macro/literal/operator provenance,
receiver-domain evidence resolution, and a shared evidence-record substrate for
source, domain, import, symbol-identity, guard,
place/effect, selected library API occurrence, value-domain/law contracts, and
sequence-surface facts.
JS/TS, Python, and Rust `await` expressions are preserved as raw async protocol
boundaries with `Source::Protocol(Await)` evidence instead of being erased into
their operand. JS/TS and Python `yield` expressions are preserved as generator
protocol boundaries with `Source::Protocol(Yield)`. Rust `async {}` and `?` are
likewise preserved as protocol boundaries with `Source::Protocol(AsyncBlock)` and
`Source::Protocol(TryPropagation)`. Go goroutine spawn, deferred calls, channel
send/receive, receive-status projections, and `select` boundaries are also
preserved as raw source-backed protocol anchors rather than ordinary calls,
values, or sequence tags. Python comprehension lowering now records whether a
HOF came from a list comprehension, set comprehension, dict comprehension, or
generator expression, and exact/value consumers use that surface evidence before
applying materialization or demand-sensitive laws.
Library/API identity is consolidated through internal `LibraryApiContract` rows
for factory, constructor, selected property/non-factory method/view surfaces,
and selected non-call sentinels, with occurrence evidence covering selected
JS-like static/global APIs and static index-membership calls, JS/TS/Java
`length` property reads, Python builtin/import-backed APIs, Rust free-name/path
APIs including `Option::Some`/`Option::None`, Ruby require-backed APIs, Java
`java.util` APIs including selected empty constructors, JS regex API calls, and
selected language-scoped receiver-method APIs such as collection membership,
map lookup/defaulting, map-key views, iterator identity adapters, Rust scalar
integer methods, Rust `Option::and_then`, Rust `zip`, and HOF/reduction methods.
Selected producer-covered factory/API calls now also emit dependent receiver-expression
`Domain` evidence
for their result container domain, and normalize emits binding-anchored `Domain`
evidence for immutable local/module bindings whose initializer domain and
non-mutation conditions are proven by first-party evidence/analysis.

## What exists today

nose now has a first internal semantic-kernel facade, but most of the engine is
still being migrated toward it.

- `nose-il` defines a compact shared IL, `Lang`, `Builtin`, `HoFKind`, operators,
  literals, source spans, units, and pack-facing internal `EvidenceRecord` facts.
- `nose-semantics` defines the first-party semantic profile facade: language,
  source-fact, operator, effect, fragment, module, stdlib, builtin, method-call,
  property, async, iterator-adapter, builder-append, and factory contracts.
- `nose-frontend` owns tree-sitter parsing, per-language lowering, embedded
  `<script>` extraction, source/domain/import/symbol/guard/place/effect/API/
  sequence evidence emission, and Raw-node coverage.
- `nose-normalize` owns desugaring, alpha-renaming, recursion normalization,
  immutable binding-domain evidence inference, dataflow, CFG/algebra
  normalization, type-gated value-graph rules, and the interpreter oracle.
- proof-sensitive value-graph laws are starting to move into named rule modules
  under `crates/nose-normalize/src/value_graph/rules/`; `clamp` and
  `promise_then` are the current examples.
- `nose-detect` owns unit extraction, exact fragment contracts, effect fragments,
  value/shape features, candidate generation, clustering, and ranking.
- `formal/obligations` records proof obligations for proof-sensitive rules.

The current model already enforces the main product principle: exact semantic
matches must be fail-closed and false merges are bugs.

An experimental `abstraction` scan mode now exists as a weak sibling surface over
`near`, not as an exact semantic relaxation. It keeps only same-language candidates
whose family-wide normalized IL differs by exactly one shared supported literal leaf
position and emits an `abstraction_witness` with a typed hole, a reason code, checked
member count, observed literal classes, and caveats such as `numeric-domain-sensitive`.

## Implemented facade contracts

The current facade is compiled Rust, not an external manifest schema. It is
intended to make the future pack extension boundary explicit while behavior is
migrated.

- The first-party profile exposes pack id and trust policy separately from
  channel eligibility. `ChannelEligibility` describes where a fact may be used;
  first-party/default status is pack provenance, not an analysis channel.
- `Il::evidence` is now the shared internal substrate for source, domain, import,
  symbol-identity, guard, place/effect, selected library API occurrence, and
  sequence-surface proof facts. Records carry ids, stable source anchors, kind,
  provenance, dependencies, and asserted/ambiguous status. Lookups in
  `nose-semantics` fail closed on ambiguous, conflicting, or dependency-broken
  evidence. Source-origin and parameter-domain proof is now evidence-only;
  explicitly legacy helper fallbacks remain only for proof families whose
  evidence migration is not complete.
- `OperatorSemantics` now owns the first shared operator contracts:
  comparison-direction transforms, comparison negation, equality operand
  commutativity, comparison-lattice laws, abs/min/max/selection guard laws,
  static cardinality thresholds, JS-like static `indexOf`/`findIndex`
  thresholds, and source membership operators. Algebra normalization, CFG
  branch orientation, value-graph comparison/count rewrites, and strict exact
  static-index gates consume these contracts instead of local operator tables.
  The old `primitive_order_comparisons()` helper remains as a compatibility
  wrapper around the stricter lattice law contract.
- `ValueDomain` and `ValueLaw` now own the first shared domain preconditions for
  value-graph and recursion laws. The old normalize-local `Ty` lattice and
  `types.rs` inference module are gone. `nose-semantics` infers only the coarse
  domains required by current first-party laws: numeric, boolean, string,
  sequence, or unknown. The inference consumes parameter `Domain` evidence
  first, then a conservative fixpoint over strict operator uses, literal and
  builtin result domains, and subexpression result domains. Value graph add
  commutativity/associativity, numeric negation/idempotence, boolean AC
  simplifications, factor distribution, large formula compaction, and structural
  recursion folds now consume `ValueLaw` contracts rather than a normalize-local
  type helper. Unknown remains optimistic only for the historical non-concat
  `+` policy; explicit string/sequence domain evidence keeps concatenation
  ordered, and numeric/boolean laws require positive domain proof. The current
  `ValueLawContract` is still an internal law-id/requirement facade: per-use
  provenance and independent conformance status are not yet tracked as separate
  value-law evidence records.
- Source facts are now first-class internal evidence for source distinctions that
  the shared IL erases. JS/TS frontends emit construct syntax, async `await`,
  generator `yield` boundaries, regex literal, strict/loose equality,
  strict/loose inequality, and `instanceof` facts. Python emits async `await`,
  generator `yield` boundaries, list/set/dict/generator comprehension surfaces,
  value equality/inequality, and identity equality/inequality facts. Go emits
  protocol facts for `go`, `defer`, channel send/receive, receive-status
  projection, `select`, and select cases/defaults. Rust emits macro invocation
  syntax for selected macro-backed APIs plus async/error protocol facts for
  `.await`, `async {}`, and `?`. These are stored directly as
  `EvidenceRecord::Source`; there is no source-fact side-table fallback.
  Normalize and detect consume source facts only where a semantic contract
  requires that exact source surface. Current JS/TS/Python/Rust `await` nodes,
  JS/TS/Python `yield` nodes, Rust `async`/`?` nodes, and Go concurrency/channel
  nodes remain raw exact-closed protocol anchors until such a contract exists.
  Python returned generator/set comprehensions and unsupported cardinality
  surfaces stay exact-closed; supported list/generator terminal reductions can
  still reopen only through consumer-specific demand checks.
- Free-function builtin contracts are language- and arity-constrained. Supported
  Python/Go free builtins such as `len`, `sum`, `min`, `max`, `any`, `all`, and
  Go `append` require admitted `LibraryApi(FreeFunctionBuiltin)` occurrence
  evidence whose dependencies prove the unshadowed builtin/global callee before
  exact lowering.
- Method contracts carry receiver obligations such as exact collection, exact
  protocol, exact option, exact string, exact primitive integer, exact map literal,
  imported namespace, or unshadowed global.
- Source-level `ParamSemantic` facts are stored directly as
  `EvidenceRecord::Domain`, and `nose-semantics` resolves receiver-domain
  evidence through a shared `DomainRequirement` contract. Consumers check exact
  receiver node evidence first, then immutable binding evidence for local or
  module variables, then scoped parameter evidence, and fail closed on
  ambiguous/conflicting/dependency-broken records without consulting a side-table
  mirror. Post-desugar value-graph receiver gates and strict exact receiver
  gates consume this same helper layer; desugaring and early idiom
  canonicalization still run before immutable binding-domain inference and only
  see domain evidence already present at that point. This preserves the current
  Array/Collection/Set/Map/Option/String/Integer/Number and ByteArray
  distinctions. First-party producers now attach
  receiver-expression domain facts directly for selected admitted library/API
  factory results, and normalize emits binding-anchored `Domain` evidence for
  single-assignment local/module bindings whose initializer has asserted
  sequence or result-domain evidence and whose binding has no direct mutation
  under the current first-party mutation scan. Binding-domain lookup matches the
  binding `local_hash` and only applies an assignment to receiver uses that occur
  after it. That mutation scan is producer policy; general mutation/effect
  evidence remains separate future work.
- Property builtin contracts are language-constrained occurrence contracts, not
  selector guesses. JS/TS/Vue/Svelte/HTML and Java `length` reads are admitted
  only when a `LibraryApi(PropertyBuiltin(Len))` record is anchored to the
  `Field` node and its dependencies prove the receiver contract. JS-like
  `length()` is not a method-call cardinality contract. JS/TS
  `filter(...).length` is admitted only after the receiver has already entered
  a proven collection/HOF value and raw HOF calls carry admitted `LibraryApi`
  occurrence evidence. JS object `.length` remains a property read, not
  collection cardinality.
- Promise `.then` has a JS-like library API contract, but exact beta-reduction
  is closed until a pack/frontend can prove a Promise-like receiver.
- Rust iterator identity adapters (`iter`, `into_iter`, `collect`, `to_vec`,
  `copied`, `cloned`) are language-, arity-, and receiver-proof constrained
  through `LibraryApiContract` and admitted `LibraryApi` occurrence evidence.
  Normalize's exact protocol receiver admission consumes this same contract
  instead of accepting same-named methods from other languages.
- Rust method `zip(...)` is admitted as a protocol-pair operation only through
  the Rust library method-call occurrence contract and exact protocol proof for
  both sides.
- Rust stdlib path contracts for `Some`/`Option::Some`,
  `None`/`Option::None`, `Option::and_then`, and `Vec::new` carry the exact
  selector and shadow-root requirement through `nose-semantics`. First-party
  lowering/normalization now emits admitted `LibraryApi` occurrence evidence for
  `Some(...)` calls, `Some(_)` pattern selectors, bare `None` `Var`
  occurrences, and `and_then(...)` calls only when the shadow and receiver
  obligations are satisfied. The Rust frontend preserves `if let` pattern tests
  instead of lowering them directly to null/not-null builtins, so Option
  absence/presence is admitted only through the contract-backed occurrence path.
- Collection factory, map factory, and selected constructor identity now have an
  internal `LibraryApiContract`
  shape in `nose-semantics`. It separates API identity from result eligibility,
  so callers can distinguish "this is Java `Arrays.asList`" from "this argument
  can be canonicalized as a membership collection." Shared contracts cover
  Python free-name factories (`list`, `set`, `frozenset`, `tuple`), Python
  imported `collections.deque`, Rust
  `std::collections::{HashSet,BTreeSet,VecDeque,HashMap,BTreeMap}::from`, Rust
  `vec!`/`Vec::new`, Java `List.of`/`Set.of`/`Arrays.asList`, Java
  `new ArrayList<>()`/`new LinkedList<>()`, Java `Map.of`/`Map.ofEntries`/
  `Map.entry`, Ruby `require "set"; Set.new(...)`, and JS-like `new Set(...)`/
  `new Map(...)`. Normalize and strict exact gates consume this shared contract
  source. Producer-covered surfaces additionally require admitted `LibraryApi`
  occurrence evidence whose dependencies carry the local import, earlier
  top-level require, unshadowed-global, macro-invocation source,
  construct-syntax, or regex-literal proof. Selected producer-covered result
  calls emit dependent `Domain` evidence for the result receiver:
  collection-like factories as `Collection`, set factories/constructors as
  `Set`, map factories as `Map`, and JS-like one-argument `Array.from` as
  `Array`. Java `Arrays.asList(x)` with exactly one argument is excluded because
  array-spread versus single-element provenance is ambiguous without additional
  proof. `Map.entry`, `Array.isArray`, `Boolean`, regex `.test`, `math.prod`,
  `Arrays.stream`, map `get`, iterator adapters, promise `.then`, and generic
  method contracts do not emit result-domain evidence under the current
  vocabulary. Entry-shape, mutation, demand, and exact-safety obligations remain
  separate contract checks at the consumer.
- Selected non-factory library/API surfaces also consume `LibraryApiContract`
  rows before normalize, value-graph, or strict exact paths assign semantics.
  Current rows cover map-key views and wrappers, Java/Rust/JS-like map `get`,
  Python/Java/Ruby map defaulting through method contracts, Rust
  `get(...).is_some()`/`unwrap_or(...)`, JS-like `Array.isArray`, `Boolean(...)`,
  regex-literal `.test(...)`, Python `math.prod`, promise `.then`, Rust/Java
  iterator adapters, Java `Arrays.stream`, and the language-scoped method-call
  surfaces already admitted by `method_call_contract`. These rows carry callee
  identity and result obligations; local consumers still prove receiver domain,
  import/symbol identity, source facts, exact-safe arguments, fallback demand
  shape, and mutation safety.
- Selected API call occurrences now also have `LibraryApi` evidence records when
  they remain as raw call nodes. First-party lowering emits occurrence evidence
  for JS-like `Array.from(...)`, `Array.isArray(...)`, `Boolean(...)`,
  `new Map(...)`, `new Set(...)`, and static `indexOf`/`findIndex` membership
  calls whose receiver is a proven static non-float collection literal; Python
  builtin collection factories such as `list(...)` when the callee is proven as
  an unshadowed free name; Python
  `collections.deque(...)` when the callee is proven through
  `from collections import deque`, an alias such as
  `from collections import deque as Values`, or `import collections;
  collections.deque(...)`; Python `import math; math.prod(...)`; Rust
  `vec!(...)` when source syntax proves a macro invocation, `Vec::new()`, and selected
  `std::collections::{HashSet,BTreeSet,VecDeque,HashMap,BTreeMap}::from(...)`
  factory paths when their root-shadow policy is proven; Ruby
  `require "set"; Set.new(...)` when an earlier top-level `Import::Require("set")`
  depends on unshadowed `require` proof and unshadowed `Set` receiver proof
  exists; Java `java.util` static factories/adapters such as `List.of`,
  `Set.of`, `Arrays.asList`, `Map.of`, `Map.ofEntries`, `Map.entry`, and
  `Arrays.stream`, plus selected empty `new ArrayList<>()`/`new LinkedList<>()`
  constructors; and JS-like regex-literal `.test(...)`. These records depend on
  the relevant `QualifiedGlobal`,
  `UnshadowedGlobal`, import-backed call-site `Symbol`, `Import::Require`,
  macro-invocation `Source`, construct-syntax `Source`, `SequenceSurface`, or
  regex-literal `Source` evidence. Calls
  collapsed into specialized guard surfaces emit guard evidence instead.
  `nose-semantics` resolves these records with a three-state result: admitted,
  missing, or rejected. Value-graph, idiom, strict exact, and provider snapshot
  consumers for these producer-covered surfaces require admitted occurrence
  evidence; missing, conflicting, or dependency-broken API evidence keeps the
  exact path closed. Older import/symbol/source facts are still required
  dependencies of the occurrence evidence, but they no longer act as fallback
  API-identity proof for these surfaces. Where a producer emits result-domain
  evidence, that `Domain` record depends on the `LibraryApi` occurrence record,
  so broken API proof also closes receiver-domain proof. The `LibraryApi` record
  itself proves API identity only; source, exact-safe argument, result-shape,
  mutation, and demand/effect obligations remain separate.
- Receiver-method calls that remain as raw `Field`/`Call` nodes now emit
  `LibraryApi` occurrence evidence for the first-party method families currently
  backed by `LibraryApiContract`: map `get`, map-key views, iterator identity
  adapters, and generic language-scoped method-call contracts such as
  collection/map membership, map defaulting, count methods,
  string/collection predicates, Rust scalar integer methods, Rust
  `Option::and_then`, Rust `zip`, and HOF/reduction methods. The
  occurrence record is admitted only for the exact language/method/arity row and
  depends on receiver proof: node/binding/parameter `Domain`, `SequenceSurface`,
  imported namespace or unshadowed-global `Symbol`, or a nested admitted
  `LibraryApi` result such as a collection/map factory, map-key view, iterator
  adapter, HOF, or map `get`. First-party lowering seeds these records when the
  receiver proof already exists; normalize refreshes and upserts first-party
  records after immutable binding-domain inference and again after final
  CFG/dataflow/algebra rewrites, so bindings such as
  `VALUES = List.of(...); VALUES.contains(x)` keep the same semantic fingerprint
  as direct factory receivers without reopening selector-only fallbacks.
  Normalized HOF receivers keep their same-span admitted `MethodCall(HoF(...))`
  occurrence as protocol evidence, so downstream adapters such as Rust
  `.collect()` can consume a canonicalized `filter_map` receiver without trusting
  the `collect` selector alone.
- Java empty collection constructor contracts cover `new ArrayList<>()` and
  `new LinkedList<>()` through `LibraryApiContract` rows only for the Java
  `java.util` list types. Simple names require exact `java.util` import proof or
  earlier `java.util.*` wildcard import proof, plus no local type declaration
  with the same simple name. A `java.util.*` wildcard import is not enough when
  another package explicitly imports the same simple type; fully-qualified
  `java.util.*List` names carry the namespace proof in the selector itself.
  First-party Java lowering preserves these supported constructors as construct
  `Call` nodes and emits admitted `LibraryApi` occurrence evidence. Value-graph
  collection canonicalization and result `Domain(Collection)` evidence require
  that occurrence proof, so source/import facts alone do not reopen the exact
  path.
- Builder append contracts are separate from arbitrary method calls. A selector
  such as `push`, `append`, or `add` is not proof by itself. First-party
  frontend/normalize paths must prove the receiver or active-builder contract,
  lower the call to canonical `Builtin::Append`, and emit
  `Effect(BuilderAppendCall)` before exact fragments can treat it as an append
  effect. Value-graph active list-builder paths still consume the method
  selector only after a local builder seed is active.
- Exact fragment surface proofs for Java `this.field`, Java `return this`,
  non-overloadable C/Go/Java index assignment, and single-item builder append
  calls are now shared through `nose-semantics`; predicate and contract paths
  consume the same IL-level proof helpers. Raw selector-only append calls stay
  exact-closed as append effects, though they may still participate in the
  separate opaque-call policy as generic `Other` effect context.
- Value-graph and oracle same-unit field state are receiver-aware: a cached write
  is keyed by receiver/place plus field name, so `a.x = v` can satisfy `a.x`
  but not `b.x`, and final field-write sinks preserve the receiver identity.
  Same-unit value-graph readback uses syntactic receiver/place evidence only; it
  does not assume aliasing or computed call-result receivers.
- Exact-fragment place/effect gates now have the first pack-facing evidence
  substrate. First-party lowering and normalize refreshes emit
  `Place(SelfReceiver)` and `Place(SelfField)` for Java `this`/`this.field`,
  plus `Effect` evidence for canonical builder append calls, C/Go/Java
  non-overloadable index writes, and Java self-field writes. Fragment
  recognizers require these records; missing, conflicting, ambiguous, or
  dependency-broken place/effect evidence closes the exact path instead of
  reopening a language/shape fallback. Self-field place/write records depend on
  the matching receiver/place records.
- `SeqSurfaceContract` now centralizes first-party lowered sequence tags and
  keeps separate axes for exact-tree safety, membership-collection admission,
  map-entry-list admission, imported-literal eligibility, and value-graph
  canonical tags. Strict exact gates, value-graph sequence lowering, and
  sibling-module literal export checks consume this contract only through
  matching `SequenceSurface` evidence rather than raw tag spelling or local
  string allowlists. Untagged `Seq` remains an internal grouping surface and
  does not itself prove exact collection semantics; the older Python empty
  sequence collection case is handled only by the explicit collection profile
  path.
- Collection reductions such as Rust `Iterator::count()` and Java
  `Stream.count()` are admitted through library method contracts plus exact
  protocol receiver proof, not through a bare method-name check.
- Java stream source adapters are split by proof through library API contracts:
  `receiver.stream()` requires an exact iterable receiver, while
  `Arrays.stream(xs)` requires the `java.util.Arrays` import binding and no local
  `Arrays` type shadow.
- Cross-file immutable import replacement now copies the provider's closed
  evidence subgraph for the exported literal expression, so a Java static import
  of `LOOKUP = Map.of(...)` carries the provider's `java.util.Map` proof into
  the importing file only when the provider emitted that import proof. Copied
  provider nodes and evidence anchors keep provider source-origin spans, while
  copied dependency ids are rewired inside the importer IL; this prevents
  importer-local scopes or same-named classes from shadowing provider-proven API
  occurrences. The replacement records `ImportedLiteralSnapshot` provenance
  depending on the importer static import proof plus copied provider evidence.
  Provider and importer module-binding mutation proof now rejects direct binding
  mutations and direct place writes such as
  `LOOKUP.clear()`, `LOOKUP.push(...)`, and `LOOKUP[key] = value`, and
  provider-side opaque argument escapes such as `mutate(LOOKUP)`, before
  imported literal provenance can enter exact matching.
- Membership and map-key membership selectors now consume language-scoped
  library method contracts before normalize/detect treat them as semantic
  containment. A method named `contains` is Java/Rust collection membership
  only; JavaScript `.contains(...)` is not accepted as array membership. Map-key
  examples include Java `Map.containsKey`, Java `keySet().contains`, Rust
  `contains_key`, Rust `get(key).is_some()`, Ruby `key?`/`has_key?`, Python
  `__contains__`, and TypeScript `Array.from(map.keys()).includes(key)` when the
  receiver is a typed/proven map.
- Map key-view library contracts distinguish collection views from iterator views:
  Python/Ruby `keys` and Java `keySet` are collection views, while JS-like
  `Map.keys()` is an iterator view and needs the `Array.from(...)` wrapper
  contract plus `QualifiedGlobal("Array.from")` symbol evidence before it can
  feed exact membership.
- Map lookup surfaces that return a value/option are now explicit library API contracts for
  Java/Rust/JS-like `get(key)` plus an exact-map receiver requirement. Python
  `dict.get(key, default)`, Java `getOrDefault`, and Ruby `fetch` still use the
  `GetOrDefault` method contract. Ruby `fetch(key) { fallback }` carries a
  separate zero-arg-lambda fallback argument contract, so block fallback demand
  is not inferred from the selector name in normalize/detect.
- JS-like static array `indexOf`/`findIndex` membership surfaces are explicit
  `LibraryApi` occurrence contracts, including the static non-float literal
  collection requirement and accepted `-1`/`0` threshold comparisons through
  `OperatorSemantics`. The occurrence record depends on
  `SequenceSurface(Collection)` evidence for the exact receiver, and value-graph
  and strict exact consumers require that admitted call occurrence before
  treating a threshold comparison as membership. Callback membership variants
  also require source operator facts: JS-like strict equality/inequality can
  enter exact matching, while loose equality, `instanceof`, and non-JS equality
  surfaces stay closed for these contracts. Callers still prove the receiver and
  lambda equality shape before exact normalization/detection accepts them.
- Source `Op::In` is not proof by itself. Strict exact collection/map
  membership currently admits Python `in` only through a language-scoped
  membership-operator contract plus receiver evidence. JS `in` remains
  exact-closed for collection membership because it means property/key existence,
  not array element membership.
- Imported namespace function contracts now cover Python `math.prod` as a product
  reduction only when the receiver is proven to be the imported `math` namespace.
  Bare globals named `math` and overwritten module bindings stay exact-closed.
- Java and JS-like `Math.abs`/`Math.min`/`Math.max` now lower through method
  contracts with an unshadowed `Math` receiver requirement instead of frontend
  text-only builtin lowering.
- Two-argument free `min(...)`/`max(...)` normalization consumes the Python
  free-function builtin `LibraryApi` occurrence contract. Same-named functions
  from other languages, including JS `min(...)`, locally shadowed Python names,
  and manually constructed calls without admitted occurrence evidence stay
  exact-closed.
- JS-like `typeof` exact-safety now consumes a language- and arity-constrained
  operator contract. A same-named function from another language or unresolved
  provider is not treated as the JS operator.
- JS-like `Array.isArray(...)` exact-safety now consumes a static-global method
  contract and requires the `Array` global to be unshadowed.
- JS-like record-shape guards that use `Boolean(value)` as the non-null/truthy
  clause consume a static-global function contract and require the `Boolean`
  global to be unshadowed. `value !== null` and `!!value` remain available when
  their own clauses prove the same record shape. The collapsed
  `Seq("record_guard")` is no longer admitted by tag spelling alone: strict
  exact and value-graph paths require matching `SequenceSurface(RecordGuard)` and
  `Guard::JsRecordShape` evidence, including subject identity, null/truthiness
  form, comparison form, and asserted API dependencies for `Array.isArray` plus
  optional `Boolean`.
- JS/TS own-property guards are also evidence-backed. The frontend emits
  `Guard::JsOwnProperty` for admitted `Object.hasOwn(obj, key)` and
  `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, key)` surfaces, with a dependency
  on the corresponding `QualifiedGlobal` proof. Strict exact and value-graph
  map-default paths require both `SequenceSurface(OwnPropertyGuard)` and that
  dedicated guard evidence; raw `Seq("own_property_guard")`, object method
  spellings, and shadowed `Object` roots stay closed.
- JS-like `undefined` is no longer frontend-collapsed to null unconditionally.
  It is preserved as a name and only treated as the nullish sentinel through an
  unshadowed-global contract. Value-graph defaulting and strict exact-safe gates
  consume that same proof, so temp-bound `Map.get(...)` defaulting can stay open
  without admitting shadowed `undefined` bindings.
- Go literal map default lookup is represented by shared contracts for both the
  outer `composite_literal` and per-entry `keyed_element` sequence surfaces plus
  the supported zero-default payload classes. Normalize and strict exact paths
  require matching `SequenceSurface(GoCompositeMapLiteral)` and
  `SequenceSurface(GoMapEntry)` evidence, so raw tag spelling alone is not
  enough. Go `composite_literal` no longer falls back to a generic collection
  sequence tag; it is consumed only by the Go map contract or left as a distinct
  surface.
- Static JS-like `indexOf`/`findIndex` membership requires a call occurrence
  whose receiver sequence surface has membership-collection admission. Untagged
  sequence expressions, destructuring surfaces, and other positional groupings
  do not become static array membership merely because their children are
  literals.
- JS/TS object literals preserve static property keys in exact map/object
  semantics, but computed property names are exact-closed until a future
  contract can prove key evaluation, coercion, order, and side-effect behavior.
- JS/TS `new Map(...)` and `new Set(...)` now require construct-syntax source
  facts distinct from ordinary calls plus `UnshadowedGlobal` symbol proof for
  the `Map`/`Set` constructor. With exact-safe static collection or entry
  arguments they can enter exact matching, including supported immutable
  module-level Set/Map bindings. Plain `Set(...)`/`Map(...)` calls and locally
  shadowed constructor names remain exact-closed.
- Static import proof facts now have a typed `ImportFactKind`/`ImportFact`
  facade in `nose-semantics`. First-party frontends emit import binding and
  namespace facts through that contract. The lowered RHS keeps only structural
  coordinate literals; proof lives in `EvidenceRecord::Import` and binding
  `Symbol` evidence. Value-graph import identity consumes sequence `Import`
  evidence into dedicated `ImportNamespace`/`ImportBinding` value ops, so raw
  import coordinate sequences can no longer become proof-bearing value nodes by
  tag shape. Imported literal replacement also consumes evidence-only import
  facts; missing or ambiguous `Import` evidence no longer proves a cross-file
  replacement.
- Symbol identity evidence now covers static imported binding/namespace aliases
  and JS/TS static-global value occurrences such as `Math`, `console`, `Array`,
  `Map`, `Set`, and `undefined` when the frontend proves no local shadow.
  Normalize idiom admission, value-graph namespace fallbacks, and strict exact
  gates consume `nose-semantics` symbol-proof helpers; imported binding/namespace
  symbol helpers no longer fall back to raw import assignment RHS parsing.
  Selected JS/TS qualified static global paths now emit `QualifiedGlobal`
  evidence as well: `Object.hasOwn` and
  `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call` gate own-property guards, while
  `Array.from` gates JS-like map-key iterator wrappers. This does not cover all
  qualified members or namespace exports.
  A spelling such as `Math`, `fmt`, or `deque` is still only a selector; exact
  consumers need symbol identity proof plus the language/API contract. Binding
  evidence does not prove later uses if the alias is rebound or ambiguous.
- TypeScript `import type ...` and type-only named import specifiers are erased
  for runtime import proof; they remain unavailable to exact semantic library
  contracts.
- Strict exact collection-membership gates no longer treat any strict-safe
  expression as collection evidence. Non-literal receivers must now be proven by
  `Domain` evidence from exact receiver nodes, immutable local/module binding
  anchors, scoped parameter annotations, or selected admitted API result records.

## Scattered semantic knowledge

Semantic knowledge still appears in several forms outside the facade:

- direct `Lang` checks and local recognizers in strict exact gates and value-graph
  rules that have not yet been expressed as shared contracts;
- source operator provenance now exists for selected JS/TS and Python
  equality-shaped surfaces, but consumption is limited to narrow contracts such
  as JS-like static membership callbacks. General equality dispatch, report
  provenance, and external pack manifests remain open;
- language-specific import, symbol, or module proof mechanics that are still
  local to frontend, normalize, detect, or value-graph callers;
- JS/TS record-shape and own-property guards now have dedicated `Guard` evidence
  records consumed by strict exact and value-graph paths. The recognizers are
  still first-party JS/TS lowering code, and broader guard families, richer
  source/API dependency records, and pack-facing dependency validation remain
  open;
- IL no longer stores import proof as `Seq("import_binding")` /
  `Seq("import_namespace")` payloads. Frontends keep an assignment plus
  untagged coordinate literals for structural similarity and nearby syntax, but
  import identity is proven only by `EvidenceRecord::Import` and associated
  `Symbol` evidence. Module/export dependency and provider-scope validation are
  still local to `nose-frontend`;
- module/import proof logic for immutable sibling-module literal bindings is
  still local to `nose-frontend`, although replacement now copies the provider's
  closed evidence subgraph into the importer, preserves provider source-origin
  spans, rewires dependency ids, and records `ImportedLiteralSnapshot`
  provenance tied to the importer static import proof;
- broader value-domain evidence and LawPack records beyond the first
  `ValueDomain` / `ValueLaw` contracts now used by value-graph arithmetic,
  boolean, factor, large-formula, and structural-recursion gates;
- named value-graph rule modules that still consume internal `Builder` facts
  instead of versioned `LawPack` records;
- hard-coded oracle evaluation rules for eager calls, short-circuit operators,
  HOFs, nullish defaulting, recursion, and effect traces;
- remaining library/API proof gates that do not yet have occurrence records.
  `LibraryApi` occurrence evidence now covers selected JS-like static/global
  APIs and static-index membership, JS/TS/Java property builtins, Python
  builtin/import-backed factories/functions, Rust free-name/path factories,
  Rust Option/scalar APIs, Ruby `require "set"; Set.new(...)`, Java `java.util`
  static factories/adapters and selected empty constructors, JS regex literals,
  generic Python/Go free-function builtins, and selected receiver-method
  families. Promise receiver proof, async/sync protocol convergence, ecosystem
  APIs, and broader protocol/API evidence paths still rely on contract rows plus
  local proof or remain exact-closed. Raw Python async-looking field names such
  as `aread` no longer rewrite to sync names without an explicit protocol/API
  evidence path, JS/TS/Python/Rust `await` expressions no longer erase to their
  operand without async protocol proof, JS/TS/Python `yield` no longer erases to
  its yielded expression without generator protocol proof, and Rust
  `async {}`/`?` no longer erase to their body or operand without async/error
  protocol proof. Go `go`/`defer`/channel receive no longer erase to ordinary
  calls or operands, Go channel send no longer relies on an untyped
  `send_statement` sequence tag, and Python list/set/dict/generator
  comprehension surfaces no longer share exact semantics merely because they
  lower to HOF-shaped IL.

These are valuable, but they do not yet share one complete semantic contract
language.

## Current strengths

- Exact matching is conservative by design.
- The value graph already separates behavioral fingerprints from fuzzy candidate
  structure.
- The oracle models return values, ordered effects, final field state, `Err`
  behavior, short-circuit `and`/`or`, `any`/`all`, HOFs, recursion, and selected
  interprocedural calls.
- Proof-sensitive normalization already has named rule modules and a Lean
  obligation registry.
- Raw-node coverage gives a practical measure of lowering gaps.
- Convergence tests and hard negatives catch many semantic boundary mistakes.

## Current limits

- Language semantics are not first-class. Many rules ask "which language is this?"
  instead of "which semantic capability has been proven?"
- Library semantics are still compiled into engine/first-party facade code.
  Internal `LibraryApiContract` rows exist, but they are not yet versioned
  external pack manifest contracts.
- Evaluation strategy is not a shared model. Eager, short-circuit, pull-lazy,
  call-by-need, async, and observable behavior are not represented by a common
  demand/effect abstraction.
- External extension points do not exist. New languages and libraries must be
  added inside the main crates.
- Report output does not yet expose semantic provenance such as pack id, contract
  id, law id, or proof status.
- First-party and external responsibility boundaries are documented and
  represented in the internal facade as provenance/trust policy, but there are no
  loadable external packs or report-level pack provenance fields yet.

## Current fail-closed choices

Several older convergence expectations are intentionally disabled or narrowed in
this worktree because the required evidence is not yet modeled:

- JS-like `.then(lambda)` does not converge with `await` code until Promise-like
  receiver proof exists.
- JS/TS, Python, and Rust `await value` does not converge with plain `value`
  until language/runtime-specific async protocol, demand, scheduling, exception,
  and effect obligations are modeled. Rust `async {}` and `?` are similarly
  closed until future/error protocol obligations are modeled. JS/TS and Python
  `yield value` remains closed against plain `value` until generator demand and
  suspension semantics are modeled.
- Go `go f(x)`, `defer f(x)`, `<-ch`, `ch <- x`, and `select` do not converge
  with ordinary calls, values, sends, or sequential control-flow variants until
  channel/goroutine/defer/select contracts can prove scheduling, blocking,
  close/zero-value, case-selection, and effect obligations.
- Python returned generator and set comprehensions do not converge with returned
  list comprehensions. `len(generator)` and `len(set_comprehension)` stay closed
  against list cardinality/count reductions until generator demand and set
  deduplication obligations are modeled. Supported list/generator terminal
  reductions remain open only where the consumer immediately demands the stream.
- Plain JS/TS `Map(...)` and `Set(...)` calls do not enter exact matching because
  constructor-only contracts require construct-syntax proof.
- Ordinary JS/TS string `.test(...)` calls do not enter regex-test exact matching
  because the receiver must have regex-literal provenance.
- Untyped JS/TS array method chains do not enter exact higher-order contracts
  unless the receiver is a literal/proven collection surface.
- Nested element method chains such as `xs.map(...)` inside a flat-map callback
  stay closed unless the nested element collection proof is available. Explicit
  nested builder loops can still converge with identity flat-map when their loop
  structure proves the emitted elements.
- Ruby untyped `Enumerable` methods, including block loop surfaces such as
  `.each` and `.each_with_index`, plus Ruby scalar/array `abs`/`min`/`max` and
  C `fmin`/`fmax`, remain closed until the relevant receiver, stdlib, and
  overload facts are modeled as contracts.
- Rust scalar `.abs`, `.min`, `.max`, and `.clamp` are admitted only for the
  current first-party primitive-integer domain. Rust float methods need a separate
  float/NaN contract and proof before they can enter exact matching.

These reduce recall in affected cases, but they are the correct precision trade
until packs can emit the missing facts.
