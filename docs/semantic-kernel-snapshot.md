# Semantic kernel snapshot

Back to [semantic-kernel](semantic-kernel.md). This page records the current
implementation shape; planned work and decision history live in
[semantic-kernel-roadmap](semantic-kernel-roadmap.md).

Snapshot date: 2026-06-07, current `main` after the semantic-kernel foundation
and proof-gated exact-scan follow-up landed in PR #100 and PR #101.

## What exists today

nose now has a first internal semantic-kernel facade, but most of the engine is
still being migrated toward it.

- `nose-il` defines a compact shared IL, `Lang`, `Builtin`, `HoFKind`, operators,
  literals, source spans, units, and parameter semantic facts.
- `nose-semantics` defines the first-party semantic profile facade: language,
  operator, effect, fragment, module, stdlib, builtin, method-call, property,
  async, iterator-adapter, builder-append, and factory contracts.
- `nose-frontend` owns tree-sitter parsing, per-language lowering, embedded
  `<script>` extraction, import facts, and Raw-node coverage.
- `nose-normalize` owns desugaring, alpha-renaming, recursion normalization,
  dataflow, CFG/algebra normalization, type-gated value-graph rules, and the
  interpreter oracle.
- proof-sensitive value-graph laws are starting to move into named rule modules
  under `crates/nose-normalize/src/value_graph/rules/`; `clamp` and
  `promise_then` are the current examples.
- `nose-detect` owns unit extraction, exact fragment contracts, effect fragments,
  value/shape features, candidate generation, clustering, and ranking.
- `formal/obligations` records proof obligations for proof-sensitive rules.

The current model already enforces the main product principle: exact semantic
matches must be fail-closed and false merges are bugs.

## Implemented facade contracts

The current facade is compiled Rust, not an external manifest schema. It is
intended to make the future pack extension boundary explicit while behavior is
migrated.

- The first-party profile exposes pack id and trust policy separately from
  channel eligibility. `ChannelEligibility` describes where a fact may be used;
  first-party/default status is pack provenance, not an analysis channel.
- Free-function builtin contracts are language- and arity-constrained and require
  unshadowed builtin/global proof before exact lowering.
- Method contracts carry receiver obligations such as exact collection, exact
  protocol, exact option, exact string, exact primitive integer, exact map literal,
  imported namespace, or unshadowed global.
- Source-level `ParamSemantic` facts are translated into `nose-semantics`
  `DomainEvidence` before normalize/detect receiver-domain gates consume them.
  This preserves the current Array/Collection/Set/Map/Option/String/Integer/
  Number/ByteArray distinctions while moving the proof vocabulary into the
  kernel facade.
- Property builtin contracts are language-constrained; a selector such as
  `length` is not enough without receiver proof. JS/TS `filter(...).length`
  is admitted only after the receiver has already entered a proven collection/HOF
  value.
- Promise `.then` has a JS-like surface contract, but exact beta-reduction is
  closed until a pack/frontend can prove a Promise-like receiver.
- Rust iterator identity adapters (`iter`, `into_iter`, `collect`, `to_vec`,
  `copied`, `cloned`) are language-, arity-, and receiver-proof constrained.
- Rust stdlib path contracts for `Some`/`Option::Some`,
  `None`/`Option::None`, `Option::and_then`, and `Vec::new` carry the exact
  selector and shadow-root requirement through `nose-semantics`;
  normalize/detect still perform the local scope shadow check. The Rust
  frontend preserves bare `None` as a name rather than lowering it directly to
  null, so Option absence is admitted only through the contract.
- Collection and map factory contracts have started moving into the facade.
  Shared rows now cover Python free-name factories (`list`, `set`,
  `frozenset`, `tuple`), Python imported `collections.deque`, Rust
  `std::collections::{HashSet,BTreeSet,VecDeque,HashMap,BTreeMap}::from`,
  Java `List.of`/`Set.of`/`Arrays.asList`, Java `Map.of`/`Map.ofEntries`/
  `Map.entry`, and Ruby `require "set"; Set.new(...)`. Callers still prove the
  local import, require, shadowing, entry-shape, mutation, and exact-safety
  obligations.
- Builder append contracts are separate from arbitrary method calls: Java `add`
  and Rust `push` are admitted only for active builder proofs.
- Exact fragment surface proofs for Java `this.field`, Java `return this`,
  non-overloadable C/Go/Java index assignment, and single-item builder append
  calls are now shared through `nose-semantics`; predicate and contract paths
  consume the same IL-level proof helpers.
- Collection reductions such as Rust `Iterator::count()` and Java
  `Stream.count()` are admitted through exact protocol receiver contracts, not
  through a bare method-name check.
- Java stream source adapters are split by proof: `receiver.stream()` requires
  an exact iterable receiver, while `Arrays.stream(xs)` requires the
  `java.util.Arrays` import binding and no local `Arrays` type shadow.
- Cross-file immutable import replacement now preserves import-binding
  dependencies used by the exported literal expression, so a Java static import
  of `LOOKUP = Map.of(...)` carries the provider's `java.util.Map` proof into
  the importing file.
- Membership and map-key membership selectors now consume language-scoped method
  contracts before normalize/detect treat them as semantic containment. A method
  named `contains` is Java/Rust collection membership only; JavaScript
  `.contains(...)` is not accepted as array membership. Map-key examples include
  Java `Map.containsKey`, Java `keySet().contains`, Rust `contains_key`, Rust
  `get(key).is_some()`, Ruby `key?`/`has_key?`, Python `__contains__`, and
  TypeScript `Array.from(map.keys()).includes(key)` when the receiver is a
  typed/proven map.
- Map key-view contracts distinguish collection views from iterator views:
  Python/Ruby `keys` and Java `keySet` are collection views, while JS-like
  `Map.keys()` is an iterator view and needs the `Array.from(...)` wrapper
  contract before it can feed exact membership.
- Map lookup surfaces that return a value/option are now explicit contracts for
  Java/Rust/JS-like `get(key)` plus an exact-map receiver requirement. Python
  `dict.get(key, default)`, Ruby `fetch(key, default)`, and Java `getOrDefault`
  still use the `GetOrDefault` method contract.
- JS-like static array `indexOf`/`findIndex` membership surfaces are explicit
  contracts, including the static non-float literal collection requirement and
  accepted `-1`/`0` threshold comparisons. Callers still prove the receiver and
  lambda equality shape before exact normalization/detection accepts them.
- Imported namespace function contracts now cover Python `math.prod` as a product
  reduction only when the receiver is proven to be the imported `math` namespace.
  Bare globals named `math` and overwritten module bindings stay exact-closed.
- Java `Math.abs`/`Math.min`/`Math.max` now lower through method contracts with an
  unshadowed `Math` receiver requirement instead of frontend text-only builtin
  lowering.
- JS-like `typeof` exact-safety now consumes a language- and arity-constrained
  operator contract. A same-named function from another language or unresolved
  provider is not treated as the JS operator.
- JS-like `Array.isArray(...)` exact-safety now consumes a static-global method
  contract and requires the `Array` global to be unshadowed.
- JS-like `undefined` is no longer frontend-collapsed to null unconditionally.
  It is preserved as a name and only treated as the nullish sentinel through an
  unshadowed-global contract. Value-graph defaulting and strict exact-safe gates
  consume that same proof, so temp-bound `Map.get(...)` defaulting can stay open
  without admitting shadowed `undefined` bindings.
- Go literal map default lookup is represented by a shared contract for the
  `composite_literal`/`keyed_element` surface and the supported zero-default
  payload classes. The value graph still constructs the canonical default value,
  and detect still checks exact-safe keys and entries.
- JS/TS `new Map(...)` and `new Set(...)` remain closed because lowering does not
  yet retain a constructor proof distinct from ordinary `Map(...)`/`Set(...)`.

## Scattered semantic knowledge

Semantic knowledge still appears in several forms outside the facade:

- direct `Lang` checks and local recognizers in strict exact gates and value-graph
  rules that have not yet been expressed as shared contracts;
- language-specific import or module proof mechanics that are still local to
  frontend, normalize, or detect callers;
- module/import proof logic for immutable sibling-module literal bindings;
- type facts and coarse type inference used to gate numeric and collection laws;
- named value-graph rule modules that still consume internal `Builder` facts
  instead of versioned `LawPack` records;
- hard-coded oracle evaluation rules for eager calls, short-circuit operators,
  HOFs, nullish defaulting, recursion, and effect traces;
- duplicated receiver/domain and library/API proof gates in desugaring,
  idiom lowering, value-graph, and strict exact paths.

These are valuable, but they do not yet share one complete semantic contract
language.

## Current strengths

- Exact matching is conservative by design.
- The value graph already separates behavioral fingerprints from fuzzy candidate
  structure.
- The oracle models return values, ordered effects, final field state, `Err`
  behavior, short-circuit `and`/`or`, `any`/`all`, HOFs, recursion, and selected
  interprocedural calls.
- Proof-sensitive normalization already has named rule modules and a Lean
  obligation registry.
- Raw-node coverage gives a practical measure of lowering gaps.
- Convergence tests and hard negatives catch many semantic boundary mistakes.

## Current limits

- Language semantics are not first-class. Many rules ask "which language is this?"
  instead of "which semantic capability has been proven?"
- Library semantics are embedded in engine code rather than declared as versioned
  API contracts.
- Evaluation strategy is not a shared model. Eager, short-circuit, pull-lazy,
  call-by-need, async, and observable behavior are not represented by a common
  demand/effect abstraction.
- External extension points do not exist. New languages and libraries must be
  added inside the main crates.
- Report output does not yet expose semantic provenance such as pack id, contract
  id, law id, or proof status.
- First-party and external responsibility boundaries are documented and
  represented in the internal facade as provenance/trust policy, but there are no
  loadable external packs or report-level pack provenance fields yet.

## Current fail-closed choices

Several older convergence expectations are intentionally disabled or narrowed in
this worktree because the required evidence is not yet modeled:

- JS-like `.then(lambda)` does not converge with `await` code until Promise-like
  receiver proof exists.
- Plain JS/TS `Map` and `Set` constructor semantics do not enter exact matching
  until constructor-vs-call proof exists.
- JS/TS regex literal `.test(...)` does not enter exact matching until lowering
  preserves regex-literal provenance distinct from ordinary string literals.
- Untyped JS/TS array method chains do not enter exact higher-order contracts
  unless the receiver is a literal/proven collection surface.
- Nested element method chains such as `xs.map(...)` inside a flat-map callback
  stay closed unless the nested element collection proof is available. Explicit
  nested builder loops can still converge with identity flat-map when their loop
  structure proves the emitted elements.
- Ruby untyped `Enumerable` methods, including block loop surfaces such as
  `.each` and `.each_with_index`, plus Ruby scalar/array `abs`/`min`/`max` and
  C `fmin`/`fmax`, remain closed until the relevant receiver, stdlib, and
  overload facts are modeled as contracts.
- Rust scalar `.abs`, `.min`, `.max`, and `.clamp` are admitted only for the
  current first-party primitive-integer domain. Rust float methods need a separate
  float/NaN contract and proof before they can enter exact matching.

These reduce recall in affected cases, but they are the correct precision trade
until packs can emit the missing facts.

## Known migration targets

The first high-value targets for semantic-kernel extraction are:

- field/place identity for field reads and writes, replacing field-name-only
  state with receiver-aware proof;
- constructor facts for JS/TS `new Map` and `new Set`, which are now explicit
  closed contracts waiting on construct-vs-call proof;
- regex literal provenance for JS/TS `.test(...)`;
- resolved symbol facts for Java/Rust stdlib factories instead of the current
  path/name plus shadow-proof contracts;
- nested collection element proofs for iterator chains and builder convergence;
- Promise/future/thenable receiver facts;
- versioned receiver/domain evidence records to replace the current
  `DomainEvidence` facade as the pack-facing proof vocabulary for collection,
  map, option, string, integer, and byte-array domains;
- demand/protocol contracts that distinguish eager arrays, lazy iterators,
  streams, callbacks, futures/promises, and call-by-need thunks;
- demand/error contracts for language-core oracle behavior such as non-iterable
  `for`/`foreach` evaluation;
- LawPack-facing ids for named value-graph rules, with the existing formal
  obligation metadata kept as the first-party proof boundary;
- module export visibility, path resolution, and mutation proof;
- provenance fields in scan JSON for pack id, contract id, law id, and evidence
  status.
