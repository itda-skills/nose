# Semantic normalization

Normalization is step 2 of the pipeline in [architecture](architecture.md); the
experiments that validated these passes are in [experiments](experiments.md).

The IL today is a *normalized AST*: it canonicalizes surface syntax (loops,
idioms, identifiers, commutativity, local control flow). That captures Type-2 and
shallow Type-3 clones. The genuinely hard, high-value frontier is **semantic**
normalization — making structurally-different but behaviorally-equivalent code
converge. Three tracks, all pursued.

Guiding constraints for every pass:
- **Determinism**: same input → same output, independent of arena order.
- **Soundness is axis-dependent** (the two-axis principle, [experiments](experiments.md) §AH).
  nose has two fingerprints over this IL: a **behavioral** one (the value graph /
  GVN — *what the code computes*) and a **representation/candidate** one (structural
  shape, used by `scan`'s default candidate mode). The behavioral fingerprint is
  **sound by intent** — a *false merge* (two behaviorally-different snippets sharing a
  value-graph fingerprint) is a **bug**, not an accepted approximation. Soundness is
  enforced by an **independent interpreter oracle** (`nose verify`) that interprets the
  *pre-canonicalization* core IL — so a behavior-changing canon cannot mask itself — plus
  a **canon-preservation** check (core-IL behavior must equal full-IL behavior). The §AS
  hunt fixed seven false merges; §AX, using the now-independent oracle, fixed a whole
  further class of *treating-a-non-commutative-op-as-commutative* bugs (value `and`/`or`,
  `!!x`, `not(Err)`, `x+0`/`x*1`, string-`+` operand sort). The core canons are also
  **Lean-proven** (`formal/`). Operations whose commutativity, associativity, or
  identity depends on value domain are **domain-gated**, never assumed: `+`
  commutes and associates only on non-concat operands. String/list `+` is ordered
  concatenation, and JS/TS/Vue/Svelte/HTML/Java mixed string coercion also makes
  grouping observable (`"a"+2+3` vs. `"a"+(2+3)`). In those languages the value
  graph flattens or reorders `+`, rewrites `x-y` as `x+(-y)`, or distributes
  unary negation over addition only after every `+` leaf is proven non-concat.
  JS loose equality over non-null operands and positive/negated JS `instanceof`
  are also exact-closed behind their source operator facts; JS-family relational
  comparisons stay exact-closed until both operands carry numeric proof, because
  string/string comparison is lexicographic. Scalar/literal/operator-proven
  TypeScript operands can use primitive comparison laws; `number[]` callback or
  loop elements do not yet provide element-domain numeric proof. Negated order
  comparisons use the `!(a < b)` -> `a >= b` dual only with integer-domain proof
  because `NaN` breaks that equivalence. `x == null` remains the modeled nullish
  check, while strict null equality stays separate.
  Python free `abs(...)` and sign-test ternary absolute-value idioms lower to
  the modeled Abs node only with integer-domain proof; untyped or element-derived
  operands stay closed because signed zero and non-integer domains are observable.
  `and`/`or` commute only on Bool (else they are the value-returning
  short-circuit `Phi`). Identity elimination `x+0`/`x*1`→`x` is dropped
  entirely — it is unsound for non-number domains (`"a"+0` Errs), and value-domain
  inference is optimistic (it would infer `Number` from the `*1` itself), so even a
  number-domain gate can't make it safe.
  Typed emptiness checks carry the proven receiver domain in the value graph: collection
  receivers, arrays, and strings do not share the same strict fingerprint merely because
  each surface exposes an “empty” idiom. A real Netty audit caught this boundary when Java
  `Object[]` length, `Queue.isEmpty()`, and `String.isEmpty()` had collapsed.
  Java `Arrays.asList(values).contains(x)` also carries the array domain when `values` is
  a proven array parameter, keeping element membership distinct from singleton-list
  membership such as `List.of(values).contains(x)` or `Arrays.asList(listParam).contains(x)`.
  Source membership operators are language-scoped: Python `in` can enter exact
  collection/map membership when the receiver is proven, while JavaScript `in`
  remains exact-closed for collection membership because it is a property/key
  existence operator.
  Module-binding facts respect alpha's per-function cid spaces: top-level assignment cids may
  resolve back to module symbols, but cids inside functions and lambdas are local and never
  prove or shadow a module binding by table index alone.
  The oracle also propagates `Err` through append receivers (including computed and
  field receivers) and arguments, so list-building effects do not silently absorb failed
  target or item computations; binary left operands and index bases fail before later
  operands/subscript expressions run; index assignment target base/subscript errors stop
  before recording a store effect; and C-style loop updates plus for-each iterable evaluation propagate
  runtime errors just like the loop condition and body.
  Eager builtin arguments (left-to-right), direct
  self-recursion call-by-value arguments, list/tuple literal items, reduce initial values,
  higher-order map/filter/filter-map/flat-map/reduce, and `any`/`all` predicate errors also stay
  observable instead of being hidden inside a collection value or coerced through truthiness
  into `false`. Java stream expression-body lambdas are evaluated as callback expressions,
  while block/effectful callbacks still execute through the statement path and preserve
  their effect trace. The filter-map oracle model treats callback-level `Null` as absence,
  propagates `Err`, and emits every other value, including falsey values such as `0`; the
  engine mirrors direct Rust `if p { Some(v) } else { None }`, match-guard option callbacks,
  pure `Some(x).and_then(...)` helper chains, and guarded builders today. Wrapped
  `Some(None)`-style callbacks are emitted `Null` payloads, not dropped items, while
  effectful callbacks and unmodeled option helper chains remain fail-closed.
  Rust Option pattern predicates likewise stay closed unless the selector has
  admitted `Some`/`None` API evidence and the pattern surface has Rust
  tuple-struct wildcard source evidence.
  Rust Result channel predicates follow the same fail-closed boundary:
  `Ok(_)`/`Err(_)` patterns and `is_ok`/`is_err` calls enter value-graph
  equivalence only with admitted `nose.rust.stdlib.result` API evidence,
  exact-Result receiver or scrutinee domain proof, and wildcard tuple-struct
  pattern source evidence for pattern surfaces. Unqualified `Result<T, E>`
  receiver proofs close when the current Rust module defines its own `Result`
  type; lazy/defaulting and panic-like Result helpers remain opaque.
  Supported JS-like local Promise continuations can reduce in the value graph
  only after admitted Promise API evidence and PromiseLike receiver proof.
  `Promise.resolve(...).then(...)`, handler-returned `Promise.resolve`,
  `Promise.reject(...).catch(...)`, and
  `Promise.reject(...).then(undefined, ...)` are modeled as fulfilled/rejected
  Promise states. The reduced value remains wrapped in a Promise boundary, so it
  does not merge with synchronous code that computes the same payload; custom
  thenables, unsafe `Promise.resolve(obj)` assimilation, selector-only Promise
  methods, `.finally`, and aggregate combinators stay opaque.
  Same-file direct calls to source-proven async functions can now provide the
  same receiver-domain proof: the call-target pass emits `Domain(PromiseLike)`
  on the call result only when direct callee evidence and async source-protocol
  evidence are both present. The value graph unwraps such calls only through the
  existing pure-inline sink fence and only for non-thenable-safe returned
  payloads, so `await`, throw/rejection paths, possible thenables, and opaque
  returned calls remain closed.
  Same-file direct calls to ordinary functions can provide the same proof only
  through returned-expression evidence: the call-target pass emits
  `Domain(PromiseLike)` on the call result when direct callee evidence points to
  a non-async single-return function and that returned expression already has
  asserted PromiseLike domain evidence. The value graph evaluates only that
  returned expression for Promise receiver recovery; parameter callees,
  multi-statement bodies, missing return-domain proof, member/imported call
  returns, unsafe thenables, and broad helper inlining remain closed. The
  measured slice is recorded in [promise-direct-function-return-recovery-2026-06-29.v1.json](../bench/recall_loss/promise-direct-function-return-recovery-2026-06-29.v1.json).
  Existing DirectMethod call-target evidence can provide the same proof for the
  narrow member-call subset: the call-target pass emits `Domain(PromiseLike)` on
  a non-async single-return method call only when the target body's returned
  expression already has asserted PromiseLike domain evidence. The value graph
  evaluates only that returned expression and closes if it reads receiver context
  (`this`, `super`, or `self`), so selector-only member calls, dynamic dispatch,
  imported members, receiver-dependent methods, and broad member inference
  remain closed. The measured slice is recorded in the [Promise direct-method recovery artifact](../bench/recall_loss/promise-direct-method-return-recovery-2026-06-29.v1.json).
  Lowered aggregate surfaces now pass through a `SeqSurfaceContract`: arrays/slices can
  enter collection membership, maps/objects enter map/object value semantics, Go
  `composite_literal` map surfaces are consumed only by the Go zero-map
  contract, Rust struct literals enter exact-tree safety only through
  `SequenceSurface(RustStructExpression)`, JS object `.length` is not collection
  cardinality, untagged `Seq` groupings do not prove collection membership, and
  computed JS object keys stay exact-closed until key evaluation semantics are
  explicit.
  The remaining documented *exceptions* are large-constant/float abstraction (genuinely
  missing type information). The **fuzziness** a clone detector needs — abstracting magic
  numbers, tolerating structural difference — lives in the **candidate axis** and its
  scoring, never in the behavioral base. Never nondeterministic, either way.
- **Termination**: bounded rewriting (no infinite saturation).
- **Composition order**: desugar → evidence producers (effect, binding,
  library-api, call-target) → alpha → oracle cutoff → **recursion→iteration** →
  **dataflow** → [dce] → **cfg_norm::structure** → **algebra** → **cfg_norm::run** →
  effect/library-api evidence re-run → (later) value-graph (matching the status
  block above; CFG normalization straddles algebra — `structure()` runs before it,
  `run()` after; the evidence re-run re-anchors effect and library-API facts on
  the canonicalized shapes). Each documented below.
  The proof-sensitive producers and idiom recognizers stay split by responsibility:
  `call_target_evidence.rs` is the pass root, with direct-function, scope/binding,
  imported-target, and test modules below `call_target_evidence/`; `idioms.rs` is
  the call-canonicalization root, with receiver proof, argument construction,
  receiver-domain evidence, map/lambda surface, and test modules below `idioms/`.

## Track 1 — Dataflow normalization (value identity)

Make temporaries, intermediate steps, statement order, and common subexpressions
irrelevant. This is the highest-leverage track and the substrate for the
downstream value-graph.

- **Stage 1 — copy / expression propagation** *(implementing first)*
  Inline a variable that is assigned once, used once, with a side-effect-free RHS,
  when no statement between def and use writes a variable the RHS reads.
  `t = a + b; return t * 2` ≡ `return (a + b) * 2`. Chains fold transitively.
  Hard parts: scoping cids per function, purity approximation, the
  no-intervening-write hazard check, determinism.
- **Stage 2 — statement-order canonicalization**
  Within a block, reorder data-independent statements into a canonical order
  (topological sort keyed by a deterministic structural hash). Converges code that
  differs only by the order of independent steps.
- **Stage 3 — value-graph / GVN normal form**
  Convert a unit into a graph of *values* (each interned by `(op, operand-value-ids)`,
  commutative-aware) with global value numbering → automatic CSE, temporaries and
  renamings dissolve into value identity. Becomes the detection substrate
  (fingerprint subgraphs) and the natural home for the downstream graph/vectorize
  experiments. Hard parts: φ-handling across control flow, effect ordering,
  canonical graph hashing.
  The implementation keeps `value_graph.rs` as a module/documentation hub:
  public API entry points live in `value_graph/api.rs`, private value-graph
  model and builder state live in `value_graph/model.rs`, evidence/state
  helpers live in `value_graph/state.rs`, builder initialization lives in
  `value_graph/init.rs`, sink/path emission lives in
  `value_graph/sinks.rs`, expression dispatch is split below
  `value_graph/eval/`: core dispatch, literals/free variables, binary operators,
  field/index access, calls, and structured expressions each have a focused
  module. Value interning/canonicalization is split below
  `value_graph/canonicalize/`: core `mk` interning, operand ordering,
  unary/binary algebraic rewrites, Phi selection idioms, comparison lattice
  laws, byte-pack recognition, constants/literal-membership handling, and
  value-DAG reference checks each have a focused module. Control construction is split below
  `value_graph/control/`: unit entry, guarded-return rewrites, guard/block facts,
  static runtime-error recognition, container walking, statement dispatch, loop
  state, loop idioms, local reductions, and block-return evaluation each have a
  focused module. Collection and HOF recognition is split below
  `value_graph/collections/`: element/range values, reduction builtins,
  cardinality comparisons, map/default and membership recognition, count/product
  calls and related library-call adapters, HOF/lambda evaluation, and Rust option
  helpers each have a focused module.
  Standard-library and library-API recognizers are split below
  `value_graph/stdlib/`: collection factories, import facts, local binding
  evidence, library API span queries, map factories/access/membership, and
  integer min/max/clamp calls each have a focused module. Other focused modules
  own active builders, output extraction, pure inlining, low-level ops, and
  proof-sensitive rule modules. New value-graph behavior should land in the
  narrowest matching module instead of growing the hub file.

  A narrow Java-only selection idiom lives here: `x % 2 == 0 ? x + 1 : x - 1`
  and the equivalent `x % 2 != 0 ? x - 1 : x + 1` canonicalize to `x ^ 1`.
  The proof relies on Java primitive integer operators: even values take `+1`, odd
  values take `-1`, and the branch split avoids overflow at both signed extremes.
  It deliberately does not apply to overloadable or coercive operator surfaces.

  **Spread arguments are kept distinct.** `*iterable` / `**mapping` lower to a `Splat`
  node, not the bare inner expression, so `f(*args)` does not fingerprint as `f(args)`
  (a spread changes the calling convention). A call carrying a spread has dynamic arity:
  the inline binding plan and the oracle fail closed on it (coevo series 7, S1).

  **Keyword arguments bind by name, not position.** A Python `f(name=value)` lowers to
  a `KwArg` node carrying the keyword (the Ruby frontend already keeps the key in its
  pair form). The value graph evaluates a call's positional args in order but its keyword
  args as a name-sorted suffix, and interprocedural inlining binds each keyword to the
  parameter whose name matches (via `cid_names`). So `f(a=p, b=q)` ≡ `f(b=q, a=p)` (same
  mapping, reordered — only when the keyword VALUES are effect-free, since Python
  evaluates arguments in source order) but ≠ `f(a=q, b=p)` (different mapping) — the call's identity is the
  `(name → value)` mapping. An unrecognized keyword (one naming no parameter, or one a
  builtin recognizer does not model) fails closed to the opaque path. The behavioral
  oracle binds keywords by the same plan, so the merges it reports are genuinely verified
  (#301).

  Interprocedural pure-helper inlining also lives in the value graph. A call to
  a pure in-file helper can beta-substitute the helper body only when the call
  occurrence carries `CallTarget::DirectFunction` evidence for the exact target
  unit. The callee spelling is not a proof channel; missing, ambiguous, or
  conflicting target evidence leaves the call opaque. Two binding facts withhold
  that evidence even for a unique same-file definition, because the name's runtime
  binding is then NOT its `def` body: a **decorated** definition (`@d def f` binds
  `d(f)`), and a name **rebound at module scope** from inside another function
  (`global f; f = ...`). The frontend drops `global`/`nonlocal`, so the rebind is
  recorded as a `ModuleRebind` source fact on the assignment — without it a
  non-top-level `f = x` is indistinguishable from a local declaration, which is why
  a coarse reassigned-anywhere predicate over-fires (it kills valid inlines whose
  name a local merely shadows). A local `f = 5` carries no fact and stays a valid
  target (#302). The same exclusion covers two **dynamic** rebinds that carry no
  `global` declaration — `globals()['f'] = ...` and `setattr(<module>, 'f', ...)` —
  recognized structurally and resolved by matching the string-literal key's content
  hash to the module function it names (#307).

  Admission is *generalized*, not whitelisted: the callee body may contain loops,
  branches, builder appends, and nested proven calls — it is evaluated through the
  ordinary statement processor in the caller's builder, so a loop-accumulator
  helper canonicalizes to the same `Reduce` its hand-inlined form produces, and a
  guard-clause helper's captured returns fold to the same `Phi` a ternary builds.
  Purity is enforced at evaluation time by a **sink fence**: any ordered effect,
  throw, break, exact field write, or return reached *inside* a callee loop
  poisons the attempt, the fence rolls back, and the call falls back to the
  opaque content-keyed path (fail-closed; loop-guard `Cond` sinks pass through —
  the hand-inlined form emits them identically). Bodies that can fall off the
  end, `try`/`throw`/`break`/`Raw` statements, recursion (a cycle guard on the
  inline stack), arity mismatches, and bodies past a size ceiling never inline.
  Helpers that pass the shape walk but never inline are still seeded with a
  content-keyed identity, so two same-named helpers with different bodies keep
  distinct fingerprints at their call sites. This substrate also powers the [reinvented-helper containment channel](reinvented-helpers.md).

## Track 2 — Algebraic expression canonicalization (E-graph)

Generalize the current commutative-operand sort into a principled canonicalizer
via bounded equality saturation over a fixed rule set:
- associativity flattening (`a+(b+c)` → canonical n-ary sum); all-literal constant
  folding (`2+3`→`5`). Identity elimination (`x+0`/`x*1`→`x`) is intentionally NOT done —
  unsound for non-number domains and untypeable here (the optimistic inference would
  self-justify it).
  negation normalization (De Morgan,
  double-negation `!!x` cancelled only on Bool, equality negation, and order-comparison
  negation only after integer-domain proof);
  comparison-direction canonicalization; short-circuit `and`/`or` to the value-`Phi`.
  Distribution/factoring (e.g. `a*c+b*c -> (a+b)*c`) is applied only through the
  value-graph rule when the operands are proven numeric. String/list repetition and other
  overloadable or unproven domains stay closed.
Extract a canonical term by a cost function. Self-contained; strong on
expression-level Type-4. Hard parts: rule confluence, termination, choosing the
canonical extraction, integer/float/overflow caveats (kept approximate).

## Track 3 — Control-flow graph normalization

Beyond today's local rewrites (else-after-return, equality branch orientation, and
value-graph order branch orientation after integer-domain proof): build a
structured CFG and canonicalize equivalent shapes — flag-variable loop ↔ `break`,
nested guards ↔ flattened guards, `continue`-skip ↔ wrapped body, redundant-jump
elimination. Hard parts: structuring
arbitrary control flow, proving shape-equivalence, determinism.

A narrow value-graph CFG fact is accepted for statically-false loop entry guards: if a local
boolean is already proven `true`, `while (!local && rhs) { ... }` has an unreachable body and
update by short-circuit semantics. This deliberately does not fold the right-hand guard and
does not apply after reassignment or to unproven receiver/dynamic facts. Loop-carried
placeholders are keyed by traversal/carry slot, not source variable id, so unused parameters
do not keep equivalent loop recurrences apart.

## Track 4 — Recursion → iteration

`recursion.rs` coordinates the two recursion schemes that have a behavior-preserving
iterative form, with the proof-sensitive rule bodies split into `recursion/tail.rs` and
`recursion/structural_fold.rs`. They run in the SEMANTIC phase (after the oracle's structural
cutoff), so the loops they emit flow through dataflow / cfg-norm / the value graph and
converge with hand-written iteration.

- **Tail recursion → `while`.** `f(p…): if c₀: return v₀; …; return f(a…)` becomes
  `while not(c₀ or …) { p… := a… }; if c₀: return v₀; …; return vₖ₋₁`. The next call's
  argument bindings run each turn in a hazard-safe order (a cyclic binding such as a swap
  bails); on exit exactly one guard holds, so the post-loop guard chain returns the same base
  value. This is plain tail-call elimination — sound for *any* guards/arguments, no algebra
  needed.
- **Structural (linear) recursion → accumulator fold.** `f(p…): if base: return e;
  return HEAD ⊕ f(a…)` becomes `acc = e; while not(base) { acc = acc ⊕ HEAD; p… := a… };
  return acc`. The recursion is a right fold `HEAD₀ ⊕ (HEAD₁ ⊕ (… ⊕ e))`; the loop is a left
  fold. They are equal **iff ⊕ is an associative monoid with identity `e`**, so the rewrite
  fires only for `⊕ ∈ {+, ·}` proven `Num` (commutative + associative; identities `0`/`1`)
  with the base case returning exactly that identity literal. Short-circuit `and`/`or` are
  excluded: their early-exit skips later `HEAD`s the accumulator loop still evaluates.

Both schemes require exactly one self-call, and self-call identity is evidence-backed:
the call occurrence must carry `CallTarget::DirectFunction` evidence that points at the
enclosing function unit. A raw callee spelling is not enough. Anything else is
left untouched. Broader call-target records such as `DirectMethod`,
`ImportedFunction`, `ImportedMember`, and `DynamicDispatch` are available to exact
callee-identity consumers, but they do not currently authorize recursion rewrites.
The proof obligations [normalize.recursion.tail](../formal/obligations/normalize/recursion/tail/Proof.lean)
and [normalize.recursion.structural_fold](../formal/obligations/normalize/recursion/structural_fold/Proof.lean)
record the tail-loop equivalence, the numeric `+`/`*` fold laws, and boundary
counterexamples for cyclic tail-call bindings, subtraction, and wrong identities.
**Soundness** is checked, not assumed: the interpreter
([interp](../crates/nose-normalize/src/interp.rs)) executes user-defined calls only when
`CallTarget::DirectFunction` evidence resolves the exact occurrence to an in-file function root, so
`nose verify` interprets proven original recursion *and* the rewritten loop and flags any
behavioral difference (when the recursion terminates on the input battery — a guard like
`n == 0` that loops forever on negatives is excluded on both sides, identically). On real
code `nose verify` stays sound (0 false merges). Its concrete model covers
`range(stop)` and `range(start, stop[, step])`, including zero-step error behavior, so
range-index loops are checked under the same bounded input semantics. Nullish/option
defaulting evaluates the fallback only for a null value, so `x ?? bad()` stays interpretable
when `x` is present; the value graph also collapses repeated same-fallback defaulting such
as `(x ?? f) ?? f`. Bare `throw`/`raise` statements execute as observable `Err` behavior and
value-graph `Throw` sinks, not plain
expression effects. The interpreter models the simple `try`/handler form only when there is
no `finally` and the handler is non-empty; the handler runs after an explicit throw or a
runtime `Err` crossing a statement boundary, and stays skipped after a normal return. The
value graph mirrors the normal-return half of that boundary by skipping the handler after an
unconditional try-body return, and also replaces a side-effect-free try body that ends in a
throw or a statically visible expression error (`Div`/`Mod` by zero, or `Pow` with an
exponent outside the integer oracle's domain, including the same errors inside eager builtin
arguments, opaque/user call-by-value arguments, zero-step `range` calls, a `Seq` literal
with left-to-right effect guards, unary/binary operands, field receivers,
index bases/subscripts, or a map/filter/reduce lambda over a statically non-empty `Seq`,
plus field/index assignment target receivers/bases/subscripts, ternary conditions, and
statically selected branches) with
its handler. Richer exception control flow remains outside the oracle.
Field writes and reads evaluate their receiver before consulting or updating same-unit
field state, so receiver errors propagate instead of falling through to a cached field
value. Same-unit field state is keyed by proven receiver identity plus field name; today
the admitted first-party substrate is Java `this.field` backed by `Place(SelfReceiver)`,
`Place(SelfField)`, and `Effect(SelfFieldWrite)`. After that, reads are interpreted only
when the same unit has written that receiver+field place; an unwritten field access remains
unsupported rather than invented. The value graph follows the same boundary:
`this.x = v; return this.x` resolves the read to `v`, while an unproven field read stays
field-shaped.

Out of scope (sound but not yet convergent, or genuinely hard): tree & mutual recursion
(multiple / non-tail self-calls); list-tail catamorphisms `head ⊕ f(xs[1:])`, whose slice is
opaque to the interpreter and value graph; and the countdown-loop ↔ `range`-loop pairing,
where the rewrite's `while n != 0` countdown is correct but does not converge with a
`for i in range(n)` form.

(A pre-existing value-graph false merge surfaced while building this — a non-reduction
loop accumulator's compact `Recurrence` value was keyed on its per-iteration update only,
dropping the pre-loop **seed**, so `a + Σ` (parameter seed) collapsed onto `Σ` (literal-`0`
seed). Fixed in the same change: the recurrence now carries its seed as an operand, so the
seed reaches the fingerprint. It reproduced with hand-written loops alone — the recursion
rewrite merely made it reachable from recursive functions too.)

The same lesson later repeated for **selection reductions**: min/max loop accumulators
originally dropped their seed on the theory that a selection has no identity element to
normalize away — but that is exactly why the seed is behavior-defining (`best = 0` clamps
at 0 on empty or all-negative input; true `max(…)` does not). `nose verify` flagged the
merge the moment 2-argument `min`/`max` became interpretable. Selection reductions now
carry their seed; the seedless builtin forms (`max(xs)`, first-element-seeded `reduce`)
stay 1-arg so they only converge with each other.

### Why semantic normalization is still worth trying

Naive PDG-style slicing was below the noise floor in an earlier token-based
prototype. nose runs these analyses on a genuinely parsed, type-erased,
alpha-renamed IL, so dataflow and value identities are recoverable. Same idea,
different substrate.

## Declarative languages (CSS/HTML): the computed-style / rendered-DOM fingerprint

The pipeline above is for **imperative** code, where the fingerprint is the
behavioral value graph (GVN). [CSS and HTML markup are declarative](languages.md): a
rule's meaning is its *computed style*, an element's its *rendered DOM*, so they do not
ride any of the tracks above. In [`normalize`](architecture.md) a declarative file
branches off right after `desugar` — the whole imperative semantic phase
(recursion→iteration, dataflow, DCE, CFG/algebra) is skipped — and the exact `semantic`
fingerprint of each `CssRule` / `HtmlElement` unit is computed by `nose-normalize::css` /
`nose-normalize::html` (dispatched in `value_graph::api` by the unit-root kind, not the
file language, so one mixed file can hold CSS, JS, and markup units side by side).

The CSS fingerprint is the **canonical computed/declared style** of the rule's
declaration block, as a sorted, domain-namespaced hash multiset:

- each declaration binds its **property** to its **ordered, canonicalized value
  tokens** (`nose-normalize::css_value`: color → canonical hex, number/length →
  canonical spelling, box shorthands collapsed) — so `#fff` ≡ `#ffffff` ≡ `white` and
  `margin: 0 0 0 0` ≡ `margin: 0`, while value-token order within a declaration stays
  significant (`margin: 1px 2px` ≢ `2px 1px`);
- the multiset is order-INdependent **across** declarations and excludes the selector,
  so a duplicated declaration block under different selectors is one exact family;
- **cascade soundness:** a repeated property keeps the last, and when a shorthand and
  one of its longhands co-occur (`margin` + `margin-top`) the rule is detected as
  cascade-ambiguous (purely structurally — one property is a `prefix-` of another) and
  an order-sensitive sequence hash is added, so a reorder that changes the computed
  style cannot merge;
- **at-rule context** (`@media (...)`) is folded in, so a conditional rule never merges
  with an unconditional one;
- every hash is mixed with a CSS domain tag, so a CSS fingerprint can never equal an
  imperative one (the cross-domain false-merge guard for the language-blind exact
  channel).

Soundness here is **by construction** — the fingerprint *is* the canonical computed
style, so *equal fingerprint ⟺ equal computed style* holds definitionally — backed by
adversarial per-rule batteries (`css_value` unit tests plus convergence/hard-negative
tests; the project's primary trust mechanism, see [design](design.md)). A separate
interpreter oracle, as run for imperative code, is redundant for a declarative domain
where the fingerprint is the denotation.

**HTML markup** (`nose-normalize::html`) works the same way, with *rendered DOM* in place
of *computed style*: each `HtmlElement`'s fingerprint is a collision-resistant recursive
DOM hash combining the lowercased tag, the attribute SET (order-independent — DOM
attribute order is insignificant; a boolean attribute ≡ its empty-valued form, `class` is
a token set), and the ORDERED child sequence (child order IS significant). Tag/structure,
child order, text, and attribute values stay distinct, so a content difference never
merges; the multiset carries every descendant subtree hash so the structural `near`
channel can score partial markup similarity. Markup LEAF VALUES (an `HtmlText` run, a
CSS value token) abstract to a generic class in the *shape* tag (`node_tag`) so the near
channel scores by structure — "the same component shell with different content" — while
the exact value lives only in the declarative fingerprint. HTML and CSS hashes carry
distinct domain tags, so the language-blind exact channel can never merge HTML with CSS or
with imperative code.
