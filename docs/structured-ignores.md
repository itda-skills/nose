# Structured ignores

Structured ignores suppress accepted clone families without losing the decision
context. Use them when a finding is intentional, generated, framework-imposed, or
owned by a team that is not ready to refactor it yet. For command basics see
[usage](usage.md); for CI gates see [continuous-integration](continuous-integration.md).

## Quick start

Run nose and copy a family's full `id` field from the JSON report. Do not paste the short
`id=` prefix shown in the human drill links — that is a drill handle, not a valid `family_id`.
See [Family IDs](#family-ids).

```sh
nose query src --format json all top=0
```

Create `nose.ignore.json` in the directory where you invoke nose:

```json
{
  "ignores": [
    {
      "family_id": "479389f590c1234a",
      "reason": "generated-code",
      "note": "Generated from the same template; refactor the generator instead.",
      "owner": "platform",
      "expires_at": "2026-12-31"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then run `nose query` from that directory. nose automatically reads
`nose.ignore.json` when it exists. Use `--ignore-file <file>` or
`ignore-file = "path/to/file.json"` in
[configuration](configuration.md) when the file lives elsewhere.

Ignored families are removed from the active report and do not trip `--fail-on any` or
`--fail-on new`. The ignore file itself is the durable audit record — every suppression keeps
its reason, owner, and expiry there.

## File shape

The preferred file shape is an object with an `ignores` array:

```json
{
  "ignores": [
    {
      "paths": ["src/generated/**"],
      "languages": ["typescript"],
      "reason": "generated-code",
      "note": "Generated API bindings; source schema is the refactoring point.",
      "owner": "integrations",
      "expires_at": "2026-12-31"
    }
  ]
}
```

A top-level array of entries is also accepted for small files, but the object
shape is easier to extend over time.

Each entry must have:

| field | required | meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `reason` | yes | Short rationale category, such as `generated-code`, `framework-required`, or `accepted-risk`. |
| `family_id` | one selector required | Stable family ID printed by nose. Best for one exact finding. |
| `paths` | one selector required | Gitignore-style path globs (positive patterns only; a leading `!` negation is rejected as an error). **Every member of the family must match** — an entry covering only one copy must not hide the others from the report or the `--fail-on` gate (a `vendor/**` entry cannot silently excuse the first-party copy of a vendor clone). Best for generated directories or templates. |
| `languages` | one selector required | Language names such as `python`, `typescript`, or `rust`. Best as a broad guard combined with another selector. |
| `note` | no | Human audit context. Explain where the real refactoring point is. |
| `owner` | no | Team or person responsible for revisiting the decision. |
| `expires_at` | no | `YYYY-MM-DD`. The entry applies through that date; after it, nose reports it as expired and does not apply it. The date is evaluated against the current **UTC** day (deterministic across machines), so near a boundary an entry may expire up to one local day earlier or later than local midnight. |

When an entry has multiple selectors, all of them must match. For example, an
entry with both `paths` and `languages` suppresses only families whose every
member matches one of those paths and one of those languages. If several entries match the same
family, the first active entry supplies the metadata.

## Family IDs

`family_id` is the same 16-hex family handle recorded in baselines. It is derived from the sorted
reported location identities: displayed file path, language, start/end line span,
unit kind, symbol name, and fragment proof metadata. That makes IDs unique for
distinct reported families in one run, including hidden exact fragments that
share the same file and enclosing symbol but live on nearby lines. It also means
IDs intentionally change when a copy is added, removed, renamed, moved, or when
the reported span changes.

Baseline comparison also records member source digests, so it can keep reshaped
accepted families hidden and classify edited accepted members as `changed`.
Structured ignores that select by `family_id` are
more exact: refresh them after large code motion or after upgrading from older
nose versions whose IDs omitted span and fragment metadata. Use `paths` and
`languages` selectors when the acceptance decision should survive routine movement
inside a file.

`nose query`'s human rows carry only a short family handle in each drill link. That prefix
works with `nose query … id=` (which accepts any unambiguous prefix) but is *not* a valid
`family_id` selector for an ignore entry:

```text
src/loaders/users.py:1  load_users  3 copies · 12/14 shared, 1p · ~24 removable · copy-paste   nose query src id=479389f590
```

The full ID to copy into an ignore entry's `family_id` is the 16-hex-digit `id` field in
`--format json` (every family object carries it):

```json
{ "id": "479389f590c1234a", "...": "..." }
```

## Expired and malformed entries

Malformed ignore files are hard errors. nose fails fast for invalid JSON, unknown
entry fields, missing `reason`, invalid `family_id`, invalid path globs, invalid
dates, or entries with no selector. Silent ignore mistakes would make the report
untrustworthy.

Expired entries are different: they are valid historical decisions whose date has
passed. nose prints a warning on stderr and does not apply the entry.

## Which suppression to use

nose has three ways to suppress a finding; pick by *who* the suppression is for and
whether the decision needs to stay auditable. Reach for the inline `// nose-ignore`
marker when the reason is self-evident to anyone reading the line; reach for the
structured file when the suppression is a decision someone else should be able to find,
question, and revisit; use a baseline to accept an existing codebase in bulk. When in
doubt — or for anything going through CI — prefer the structured file, because it stays
auditable.

| mechanism | use when | tradeoff |
|---|---|---|
| Inline `// nose-ignore` | One source unit should never participate in detection. | Removes the unit before families are formed; no family metadata exists later. |
| Structured ignore file | A reported family was accepted and intentionally kept. | Keeps rationale, owner, expiry, and machine-readable ignored-family output. |
| Baseline | You are adopting nose on an existing codebase and want CI to flag only new or changed duplication. | Accepts the current state in bulk; use structured ignores for individual decisions that need explanation. |
