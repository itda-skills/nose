# Clone types — what nose covers

The standard clone taxonomy is from Roy, Cordy & Koschke, *"Comparison and evaluation of
code clone detection techniques and tools: A qualitative approach"*, Science of Computer
Programming (2009) — <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167642309000367>.
The four types:

- **Type-1** — identical fragments except whitespace, layout, and comments.
- **Type-2** — syntactically identical except identifiers, literals, and types (plus Type-1
  variations).
- **Type-3** — copied fragments with statements changed, added, or removed (plus Type-2
  variations).
- **Type-4** — fragments that perform the same computation but are implemented by different
  syntactic variants (semantic clones).

This page states what nose does for each — including where it stops. The scan modes are
detector channels, not perfect taxonomy buckets: the default combines `syntax` and
`semantic`, and `near` is the opt-in fuzzy Type-3 surface. Back to [home](home.md);
the engine is in [architecture](architecture.md).

## Type-1 — fully

Whitespace, layout, and comments never enter the IL, so Type-1 fragments produce identical
fingerprints. They are caught by the `syntax` CPD floor and by the unit fingerprints.

## Type-2 — identifiers and types fully; literals on a two-axis split

- **Identifiers** are alpha-renamed to canonical ids in the normalized unit channels, so
  renamed copies can converge under `semantic` or `near`.
- **Types** are erased during normalization.
- **Literal values** are handled deliberately on two axes. The *behavioral* fingerprint
  RETAINS behavior-defining literals (`0` ≠ `1`, `true` ≠ `false`, distinct strings/floats) —
  different literals are different behavior. The *structural* fingerprint abstracts them to
  their class. So a Type-2 clone that differs only in literal values is matched by
  `--mode near`, but deliberately kept distinct by exact `--mode semantic`.

`--mode syntax` is intentionally the CPD floor: it is excellent for copied runs that a
token detector should catch, including runs that cross function boundaries, but it is not
the whole renamed-Type-2 story by itself. Use the default or add `near` when renamed or
literal-varied copies matter.

## Type-3 — near-duplicate via similarity (the primary use)

Unit pairs are scored by value-graph + shape similarity and structural alignment, and
accepted above a threshold (0.70 by default in `--mode near`). A copy with added/removed/changed
statements scores below 1.0 but above the threshold, so it surfaces as a near-duplicate
family. How much divergence still matches is bounded by the threshold (raise it for tighter
matches, lower it for more recall).

## Type-4 — a modeled subset, not arbitrary equivalence

This is nose's distinguishing capability, but it is **bounded, not total** — arbitrary
semantic equivalence is undecidable. nose converges the equivalence classes its IL, value
graph, and canonicalizations actually model:

- loop ↔ `reduce`/`sum` ↔ comprehension ↔ `.append`/`.map` builder loop; an `any`/`all` loop
  ↔ the functional form; a `reduce`-lambda min/max ↔ `max`/`min`; `len([… if p]) ↔ Σ(p?1:0)`;
  a dict-building loop `d={}; for x: d[k]=v` ↔ the dict comprehension `{k: v for x in xs}`;
- `filter q (filter p) ↔ filter (p∧q)` (and the filtered comprehension / `.filter().filter()`
  chain / filtered builder loop);
- guard-clause ↔ nested-if, ternary ↔ early-return, min/max idioms, commutativity +
  associativity (AC-canonical operands), distribution `a·c + b·c ≡ (a+b)·c` (numeric),
  `a − b ≡ a + (−b)`, De Morgan, short-circuit `and`/`or`;
- the same algorithm written in a **different language** (incl. Rust `it.iter().filter(p).sum()`
  ↔ Python `sum(x for x in xs if p)`).

For the classes it captures, the match carries a **soundness guarantee**: equal fingerprint
⟹ equal behavior, enforced by an interpreter oracle (`nose verify`) and machine-checked in
Lean (`formal/`). See [normalization](normalization.md) for the full pass list.

### What nose does *not* do (no overclaim)

- **Different algorithms with the same result** — e.g. bubble sort vs quicksort, or two
  different primality tests — are **not** recognized. Only the modeled transformations
  converge; nose does not search for arbitrary input/output equivalence.
- **Recursion ↔ iteration** is partially modeled — a bounded subset converges (see
  [normalization](normalization.md)); general recursion↔iteration remains out of scope.
- The behavioral *proof* (`nose verify`) covers only interpretable (≈ pure) units; detection
  itself runs on every unit via the fingerprint, but pairs outside that interpretable slice
  carry no per-pair behavioral proof.
- Type-4 coverage is a **growing set of modeled equivalences**, not a guarantee about any
  given pair of semantically-equal fragments.

## Scan modes, and cross-language

Each type maps to a detection channel: **Type-1/2 → `syntax`**, **Type-3 → `near`**
(fuzzy; the threshold rides on the mode, `near:0.8`), **Type-4 → `semantic`** (exact).
The default is `syntax,semantic`; see [usage → Scan modes](usage.md#scan-modes) for the
full table and how to compose channels.

The taxonomy is usually stated within a single language; because every language lowers to
one shared IL, nose applies Type-1–4 **across languages** as well — though in practice
rarely, since cross-language fragments seldom converge to the same fingerprint.
