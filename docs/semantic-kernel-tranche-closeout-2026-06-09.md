# Semantic kernel tranche closeout, 2026-06-09

Back to [semantic-kernel](semantic-kernel.md). Current implementation status is
in [semantic-kernel-snapshot](semantic-kernel-snapshot.md); long-range phases
and history are in [semantic-kernel-roadmap](semantic-kernel-roadmap.md). This
closeout updates the post-PR #147 audit recorded in
[semantic-kernel-audit-2026-06-09](semantic-kernel-audit-2026-06-09.md).

## Scope

This page closes the first semantic-kernel foundation tranche under GitHub issue
#109. It covers the follow-up issues created from the post-PR #147 audit:

| issue | PR | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| #150 | #158 | completed the post-PR #147 raw/local semantic pocket audit |
| #151 | #160 | defined the provider-facing semantic pack extension API v0 |
| #152 | #161 | added local pack manifest loading, opt-in trust plumbing, and scan JSON pack provenance |
| #153 | #159 | added the internal demand/effect semantic substrate |
| #154 | #162 | added Promise receiver proof and conservative `.then` continuation reduction |
| #155 | #164 | expanded call-target and dispatch evidence vocabulary and resolvers |
| #156 | #165 | expanded type/domain evidence vocabulary and nominal type-domain proof |
| #157 | #163 | added semantic pack conformance harness and contribution workflow |

## Current state

The tranche is complete as a foundation, not as a finished ecosystem. The code
now has:

- a documented v0 pack extension shape for language/library semantics,
  contracts, evidence producers, dependencies, channel eligibility, trust, and
  provider/user responsibility;
- local pack manifest discovery and explicit opt-in loading, with external packs
  still treated as `metadata-only`;
- structural conformance checks for local manifests and declared fixture assets,
  without implying nose approval of external semantic correctness;
- an internal demand/effect model for admitted eager, lazy, short-circuit,
  callback, async-continuation, generator, channel, and protocol-boundary
  surfaces;
- Promise-like receiver proof for the supported first-party
  `Promise.resolve(...).then(...)` chain, while shadowed promises, custom
  thenables, unsafe assimilation, and synchronous equivalence stay closed;
- shared call-target evidence for direct functions, direct methods, imported
  functions, imported members, and dynamic-dispatch facts, with strict exact
  admitting only concrete, dependency-backed opaque identity;
- richer domain evidence for arrays, collections, iterables, iterators, sets,
  maps, records, options, results, promise/future-like values, strings,
  booleans, integer/float/number distinctions, byte arrays, and hashed nominal
  domains.

The core policy is unchanged: selectors, names, payload tags, raw IL shapes, and
broad type-text substrings are not proof. Missing, ambiguous, conflicting,
shadowed, or dependency-broken evidence must keep exact semantic convergence
closed.

## What remains

The remaining work is no longer "finish #151-#157." Those issues are closed.
The next work is to prove that the new extension boundary is practical and then
broaden producer coverage without reopening the old raw fallbacks.

| priority | issue | work | reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | #166 | first-party pack pilot | The extension boundary needs one narrow default pack-shaped implementation before broad first-party conversion or external executable producers. |
| P1 | #169 | broaden evidence producer coverage | Shared vocabularies exist, but producer coverage for call targets, richer domains, guards, aggregates, and module/export dependencies is still selective. |
| P1 | #168 | expand demand and effect contracts | Lazy, iterator, generator, async, channel, repeated, and call-by-need semantics need more precise obligations before ecosystem APIs can enter exact matching. |
| P2 | #167 | pack-facing value laws and provenance | Current `ValueLaw`/rule ids are internal; pack-facing law contracts, proof status, fixture expectations, and per-finding provenance remain open. |
| quality | #149 | quality-gate ratchets and large-file cleanup | The semantic foundation is now broad enough that the remaining large/high-complexity modules should be split before more kernel behavior accumulates there. |

## Recommended order

Start #166 first. A small first-party pack pilot is the best pressure test for
the API, loading, conformance, provenance, and evidence vocabulary already
landed. It should use compiled first-party execution and preserve current exact
behavior.

Run #149 in parallel with #166 when two workers are available. It lowers the
cost of the next semantic tranche by splitting broad files and ratcheting quality
gates, and it should not need to touch the same pack-pilot surfaces if scoped
carefully.

Start #169 after the #166 pilot has clarified the first-party pack shape, or in
parallel only for a producer family that does not depend on that shape. Start
#168 when a concrete protocol family is chosen and its demand/effect hard
negatives are clear. Start #167 after #166 has established how first-party pack
metadata and conformance results should identify semantic contributions.

Keep #109 open as the parent tracker until at least one first-party pack-shaped
semantic surface ships and the next producer/runtime tranche is re-evaluated.
