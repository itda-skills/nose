# Semantic kernel #109 closeout, 2026-06-09

This page closes the semantic-kernel foundation work tracked under GitHub issue
#109.

## Scope

The first tranche covered the follow-up issues created from the post-PR
#147 audit:

| issue | PR | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| #150 | #158 | completed the post-PR #147 raw/local semantic pocket audit |
| #151 | #160 | defined the provider-facing semantic pack extension API v0 |
| #152 | #161 | added local pack manifest loading, opt-in trust plumbing, and scan JSON pack provenance |
| #153 | #159 | added the internal demand/effect semantic substrate |
| #154 | #162 | added Promise receiver proof and conservative `.then` continuation reduction |
| #155 | #164 | expanded call-target and dispatch evidence vocabulary and resolvers |
| #156 | #165 | expanded type/domain evidence vocabulary and nominal type-domain proof |
| #157 | #163 | added semantic pack conformance harness and contribution workflow |

The follow-up tranche then pressure-tested the extension boundary and producer
model:

| issue | PR | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| #166 | #171 | shipped the first compiled first-party pack pilot, `nose.python.stdlib.type_domain` |
| #169 | #172 | broadened evidence producer coverage for imported call-target facts |
| #168 | #173 | expanded demand/effect contracts for admitted library HOF timing |
| #167 | #174 | shipped the first compiled LawPack pilot, `nose.value_graph.laws`, with family-level value-law provenance |

## Current state

The #109 migration is complete as a foundation, not as a finished ecosystem. The
code now has:

- a documented v0 pack extension shape for language/library semantics,
  contracts, evidence producers, dependencies, channel eligibility, trust, and
  provider/user responsibility;
- local pack manifest discovery and explicit opt-in loading, with external packs
  still treated as `metadata-only`;
- structural conformance checks for local manifests and declared fixture assets,
  without implying nose approval of external semantic correctness;
- an internal demand/effect model for admitted eager, lazy, short-circuit,
  callback, async-continuation, generator, channel, and protocol-boundary
  surfaces;
- Promise-like receiver proof for the supported first-party
  `Promise.resolve(...).then(...)` chain, while shadowed promises, custom
  thenables, unsafe assimilation, and synchronous equivalence stay closed;
- shared call-target evidence for direct functions, direct methods, imported
  functions, imported members, and dynamic-dispatch facts, with strict exact
  admitting only concrete, dependency-backed opaque identity;
- richer domain evidence for arrays, collections, iterables, iterators, sets,
  maps, records, options, results, promise/future-like values, strings,
  booleans, integer/float/number distinctions, byte arrays, and hashed nominal
  domains;
- a compiled first-party stdlib pack pilot for Python type-domain aliases,
  exposed as `nose.python.stdlib.type_domain`;
- broader first-party producer coverage for dependency-backed imported
  call-target evidence;
- demand/effect contracts that distinguish eager JS-like/Ruby library HOF
  callbacks from pull-lazy Rust iterator and Java Stream callbacks;
- a compiled first-party LawPack pilot, `nose.value_graph.laws`, with stable
  law ids and family-level provenance for numeric common-factor distribution
  and integer ordered min/max clamp.

The core policy is unchanged: selectors, names, payload tags, raw IL shapes, and
broad type-text substrings are not proof. Missing, ambiguous, conflicting,
shadowed, or dependency-broken evidence must keep exact semantic convergence
closed.

## Closeout Decision

#109 can close. All operational child issues created for this foundation and
follow-up tranche are complete: #150-#157, #166, #169, #168, and #167.

The remaining semantic-kernel direction is no longer blocked on #109. Future
work should be opened as new, scoped issues when a concrete language surface,
producer family, LawPack family, or ecosystem-pack runtime slice is selected.
The active companion issue is #149, which is a quality-gate ratchet and
large-file cleanup track rather than a semantic-kernel behavior migration.
