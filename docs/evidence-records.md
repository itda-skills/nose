# Semantic evidence records

Back to [semantic-kernel](semantic-kernel.md). Current implementation status is
recorded in [semantic-kernel-snapshot](semantic-kernel-snapshot.md); history and
remaining work are tracked in
[semantic-kernel-roadmap](semantic-kernel-roadmap.md). Source-origin facts are
covered in [source-facts](source-facts.md).

Evidence records are the internal substrate that lets current first-party
frontends, and future language/library packs, emit proof facts without giving
those producers authority to approve exact clones. They are facts, not verdicts.
Contracts in `nose-semantics` decide whether a fact can satisfy an exact-channel
precondition.

## Goal

- Give source, domain, import, symbol-identity, guard, place/effect, selected
  library API occurrence, and sequence-surface proof facts one shared shape.
- Make facts carry stable ids, anchors, provenance, dependencies, and status.
- Keep exact matching fail-closed when evidence is missing, ambiguous, or
  conflicting.
- Preserve existing behavior while first-party frontends emit source,
  parameter-domain, import, symbol, guard, place/effect, library API, and
  sequence-surface facts directly into the record shape.
- Make the future external pack schema a narrowing of an implemented internal
  boundary, not a speculative document-only API.

## Non-goals

- Do not let evidence records mint value fingerprints, bypass laws, or mark clone
  pairs exact.
- Do not expose this internal Rust record as the final external pack manifest or
  scan JSON schema.
- Do not certify external pack claims. nose validates record shape and fails
  closed; providers own their claims, and users own opt-in decisions.
- Do not model demand evidence or every place/effect family in this slice. The
  current place/effect records cover the first exact-fragment substrate only.

## Record Shape

`nose-il` now carries `Il::evidence: Vec<EvidenceRecord>`.

An evidence record has:

- `id`: stable within the IL file, used by dependencies;
- `anchor`: the source subject the fact is about, such as a source span,
  parameter span, binding span plus local-name hash, or sequence span;
- `kind`: the kernel-defined fact kind;
- `provenance`: emitter class, pack hash, and rule hash;
- `dependencies`: other evidence ids this fact depends on;
- `status`: currently `Asserted` or `Ambiguous`.

The current implemented kinds are:

| kind | purpose |
|---|---|
| `Source` | construct syntax, Rust macro invocation syntax, async/generator/error and Go concurrency/channel protocol boundary syntax, Python comprehension surface provenance, regex literal provenance, and source operator family |
| `Domain` | parameter, receiver-expression, or value/binding domain such as collection, map, option, string, integer, or byte array |
| `Import` | static import binding/namespace proof, Java wildcard import proof, Ruby `require` module proof, and imported-literal snapshot provenance |
| `Symbol` | resolved or proven symbol identity, with record kinds for unshadowed globals, static imported binding/namespace aliases, and selected qualified global API paths |
| `Guard` | multi-obligation guard proof facts such as JS/TS record-shape and own-property guard contracts |
| `Place` | fixed receiver/place facts currently covering `SelfReceiver` and `SelfField` |
| `Effect` | observable effect facts currently covering canonical builder append calls, non-overloadable index writes, and fixed self-field writes |
| `LibraryApi` | proof that a specific API occurrence matches a language/API contract coordinate, currently for selected call, property, and sentinel occurrences across JS-like static/global/static-index APIs, selected Python/Rust/Ruby/Java/regex APIs, generic Python/Go free-function builtins, and selected receiver-method families |
| `SequenceSurface` | lowered aggregate surface such as collection, tuple, map, pair, import proof, guard surfaces, Go composite map literals, or Go map entries |

`LibraryApi` evidence is an occurrence fact, not the whole contract. It records
the contract id, callee coordinate, arity, and dependencies for a specific
`Call`, `Field`, or `Var` node, depending on the contract surface.
`LibraryApiContract` rows in `nose-semantics` still name result semantics and
the remaining obligations. Existing evidence kinds such as `Symbol`,
`Import`, `Source`, `Domain`, and `SequenceSurface` prove those obligations; the
contract decides whether the facts are enough to admit an exact or value-graph
path. A future external pack schema may expose library API contracts, but
providers still emit facts and contracts rather than exact-clone verdicts.

Current first-party `LibraryApi` callee coordinates are intentionally specific:

- `QualifiedGlobal`-backed coordinates, such as `StaticGlobalMethod` and
  `StaticGlobalFunction`, name an allowed language/API path and depend on
  matching symbol evidence for the anchored call occurrence.
- `ImportedBinding` and `ImportedNamespaceFunction` name a module/export or
  namespace/function identity and depend on import-backed call-site symbol
  evidence. They do not infer semantics from the local alias spelling.
- `FreeName` names a language-scoped free identifier, such as Python `list`,
  Python `len`, Go `append`, or Rust `Vec`, and depends on
  `Symbol(UnshadowedGlobal)` evidence at the callee anchor plus the contract's
  shadow policy.
- `JavaUtilStaticMember` names selected Java `java.util` static factory/adaptor
  calls and depends on matching Java import-binding evidence plus source-origin
  local type shadow checks.
- `JavaUtilConstructor` names selected Java `java.util` constructors and depends
  on construct-syntax evidence plus exact import-binding evidence or earlier
  Java wildcard import evidence. Wildcard proof is constrained by Java name
  resolution: a local same-name type or explicit same-name import from another
  package keeps the occurrence closed.
- `RustMacro` names a Rust macro invocation, currently `vec!`, and depends on
  both `Source::Call(MacroInvocation)` at the call span and
  `Symbol(UnshadowedGlobal)` evidence at the macro callee anchor.
- `RubyRequireStaticMember` names a Ruby receiver/method pair, currently
  `Set.new`, and depends on both an unshadowed receiver symbol and a matching
  earlier `Import::Require` module fact whose own dependency proves the
  `require` callee identity.
- `JsGlobalConstructor` and `RegexLiteralMethod` name APIs whose identity
  includes source provenance, such as construct syntax or regex-literal receiver
  proof.
- `StaticIndexMembershipMethod` names JS-like `indexOf`/`findIndex` membership
  calls and depends on `SequenceSurface(Collection)` evidence for the exact
  receiver plus the static non-float literal receiver shape required by the
  contract.
- `Property` names a language-scoped property surface such as JS/TS/Java
  `length`. It is anchored to the `Field` node and depends on receiver proof
  such as `Domain`, `SequenceSurface`, or nested admitted `LibraryApi`
  evidence. It does not infer semantics from a property spelling alone.
- `Method` and `IteratorAdapterMethod` name language-scoped receiver methods by
  exact method string and arity. They depend on receiver proof such as
  `Domain`, `SequenceSurface`, imported-namespace or unshadowed-global `Symbol`,
  or nested admitted `LibraryApi` evidence for factory/result calls. They do not
  infer semantics from a selector spelling alone.

## Consumption Rules

Consumers should go through `nose-semantics` helpers rather than scanning raw IL
side tables.

- A lookup succeeds only when asserted evidence resolves to exactly one relevant
  fact.
- Conflicting asserted evidence makes the lookup fail.
- Dependency-broken evidence makes the lookup fail.
- `Ambiguous` evidence makes the lookup fail.
- If any relevant ambiguous, conflicting, or dependency-broken evidence exists,
  compatibility fallback must not reopen the exact path.
- Compatibility fallback is allowed only when no relevant evidence record exists,
  and only for explicitly legacy compatibility helpers.

This is stricter than a name or tag check. For example, static import lowering
keeps an assignment RHS with only untagged module/export coordinate literals;
the coordinates are not a proof channel. Import contracts consume only
`Import` evidence. If that evidence is missing or ambiguous, exact import proof
stays closed instead of falling back to the raw sequence shape. Value-graph
import identity likewise consumes only sequence `Import` evidence and
materializes dedicated internal import values, never raw `ValOp::Seq` proof
objects.

Symbol identity follows the same rule. A method selector such as `abs` or a
receiver spelling such as `Math` is not proof. Exact consumers must require a
language-scoped contract plus symbol evidence. Imported binding/namespace symbol
helpers no longer accept a raw import assignment RHS as proof. Binding-level
import evidence does not by itself prove every use of the same local name; if the
alias is rebound or ambiguous, the exact path stays closed until a node-level
symbol fact or stronger scope-resolution evidence exists.

Domain evidence follows the same fail-closed rule. First-party parameter
annotations emit `Domain` evidence on `Param` anchors, and `nose-semantics`
resolves `Domain` evidence on exact receiver-expression node anchors, then
binding anchors for immutable local/module variables, then parameter anchors. A
conflicting, ambiguous, or dependency-broken receiver-domain record closes that
receiver proof and must not fall back to side-table mirrors or selector
spelling. Binding-anchor lookup matches both source span and `local_hash`, and a
binding proof is applied to a receiver only when the assignment is visible before
that receiver use. When a receiver is an alpha-renamed parameter or local binding
reference, lookup is constrained to the nearest function/lambda scope where
appropriate so same-numbered parameter/local ids from other units do not prove
the current receiver. Method receiver contracts expose their domain-backed
obligations through `DomainRequirement`; obligations such as imported namespace,
unshadowed global, exact map literal, and future demand/effect constraints remain
separate checks.

Parameter `Domain` evidence also seeds the semantic-kernel `ValueDomain`
contract used by value-graph and recursion laws. That bridge is intentionally
narrow: integer/number domains seed `Number`, string seeds `String`, and
array/collection/set domains seed `Sequence`. The value graph may additionally
infer a domain from strict operator use, literal result domains, modeled builtin
result domains, and subexpression result domains, but the law itself is admitted
only through a `ValueLaw` contract in `nose-semantics`. This keeps string and
sequence concatenation ordered when evidence proves those domains, while numeric
and boolean laws still require positive domain proof. Today that contract records
the law id and domain requirement; pack-facing per-use value-law provenance and
conformance status remain future work rather than an emitted evidence family.

Selected `LibraryApi` result-domain evidence follows the same model. A
first-party factory call result may carry `Domain(Collection)`, `Domain(Set)`,
`Domain(Map)`, or `Domain(Array)` only after the call occurrence has admitted
`LibraryApi` evidence. The `Domain` record depends on that `LibraryApi` record,
so broken import, source, shadowing, or symbol proof closes the receiver-domain
claim as well. The result-domain record proves only the container/protocol shape
of the call result; exact consumers still prove argument safety, entry shape,
mutation, receiver requirements, and demand/effect obligations separately.

Sequence-surface evidence is also authoritative for exact/value-graph aggregate
semantics. A lowered `Seq("array")`, `Seq("object")`, `Seq("tuple")`, or
language-specific tag does not by itself prove exact-tree safety, collection
membership, map-entry-list shape, imported-literal eligibility, or a canonical
value-graph tag. Consumers resolve the tag only when a matching
`SequenceSurface` record exists at the same sequence anchor and its dependencies
remain asserted. Missing, conflicting, ambiguous, or wrong-kind surface evidence
keeps the exact/value-graph path closed.

Qualified global identity is also evidence, not a selector guess. The current
first-party JS/TS producer emits `QualifiedGlobal` only for selected static paths
whose root is proven unshadowed, such as `Object.hasOwn`,
`Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call`, `Array.from`, and `Array.isArray`.

Guard identity is separate from sequence shape. A raw `Seq("record_guard")` or a
matching `SequenceSurface(RecordGuard)` fact proves only that the frontend
lowered a guard-shaped surface. Exact consumers additionally require a
dedicated `Guard::JsRecordShape` record whose subject, null/truthiness form,
comparison form, and asserted `Array.isArray`/optional `Boolean` dependencies
match the lowered sequence. Generic `SequenceSurface(RecordGuard)` is therefore
not `exact_tree_safe`; missing, ambiguous, conflicting, wrong-kind, wrong-anchor,
or dependency-broken guard evidence keeps the exact path closed.

JS/TS own-property guards follow the same rule. `Seq("own_property_guard")` and
`SequenceSurface(OwnPropertyGuard)` are only the lowered shape; exact and
value-graph consumers require `Guard::JsOwnProperty` with an asserted dependency
on one supported qualified-global API path, currently `Object.hasOwn` or
`Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call`. Object method spellings such as
`value.hasOwnProperty(...)`, shadowed `Object` roots, missing dependencies, or
ambiguous guard evidence remain closed.

Place and effect evidence are authoritative for the exact-fragment substrate.
Raw method selectors such as `push`, `append`, or `add` do not prove an append
effect; exact consumers need `Effect(BuilderAppendCall)`, even when the call has
already been lowered to canonical `Builtin::Append`. Likewise, non-overloadable
index writes and fixed self-field writes are admitted only through `Effect`
records, with `Place(SelfReceiver)` and `Place(SelfField)` proving the
receiver/place side. First-party `Place(SelfField)` depends on the matching
`Place(SelfReceiver)`, and `Effect(SelfFieldWrite)` depends on the matching
`Place(SelfField)`. Missing, conflicting, ambiguous, or dependency-broken
place/effect evidence closes exact fragments instead of reopening a legacy
language/shape fallback.

Library API evidence follows the same fail-closed rule. If a call carries
`LibraryApi` evidence for a selected API occurrence, consumers must validate the
contract id, callee coordinate, arity, dependencies, dependency anchors, and call
shape. A conflicting, ambiguous, wrong-callee-anchor, wrong-dependency-anchor, or
dependency-broken API record on the queried call closes that API path. A record
anchored to another call is irrelevant to this lookup and leaves compatibility
policy to the queried surface. For selected surfaces that already have
first-party occurrence producers, missing `LibraryApi` evidence is also closed:
older symbol/source/import facts remain dependencies of the occurrence proof,
not alternate API-identity proofs. Compatibility fallback is reserved for
contract rows whose occurrence producer is not modeled yet. The record proves
only API identity; exact consumers still separately prove receiver/domain facts,
source-surface requirements, argument safety, result shape, mutation safety, and
demand/effect obligations.

Imported API occurrence evidence is not a broad name guess. A call-site
`Symbol(ImportedBinding)` or `Symbol(ImportedNamespace)` dependency must itself
depend on the matching binding-anchor symbol, pass rebinding and local/parameter
shadow checks, and match the current receiver/callee span when that span is
available. If normalization erases an import occurrence into a seeded import
value, consumers pass no occurrence span and rely on that validated dependency
instead of accepting an unrelated imported symbol elsewhere in the file.

## Current Producers

First-party frontends now emit these facts as `EvidenceRecord`:

- parameter semantic annotations become `Domain` evidence. Selected first-party
  library/API factory calls now also emit receiver-expression `Domain` evidence
  at the exact call node after their `LibraryApi` occurrence has been admitted.
  Normalize also emits binding-anchored `Domain` evidence for single-assignment
  local/module bindings whose initializer has asserted sequence or result-domain
  evidence and whose binding has no direct mutation under the current
  first-party mutation scan. Future packs and inference producers should use
  node or binding anchors for receiver-domain proof instead of selector spelling;
- source-origin facts become `Source` evidence. JS/TS, Python, and Rust `await`
  expressions preserve a raw async boundary and emit
  `Source::Protocol(Await)` at that source span. JS/TS and Python `yield`
  expressions emit `Source::Protocol(Yield)`. Rust `async {}` and `?` emit
  `Source::Protocol(AsyncBlock)` and `Source::Protocol(TryPropagation)`. These
  are future protocol/demand proof anchors, not evidence that the source
  operation is equivalent to its operand or body. Go `go`, `defer`, channel
  send/receive, receive-status projection, `select`, and select cases/defaults
  likewise preserve source-backed protocol anchors instead of ordinary calls,
  values, or generic sequences. Python list/set/dict comprehensions and generator
  expressions emit source-comprehension facts so exact consumers can distinguish
  eager materialized lists, lazy generators, set deduplication, and dict
  materialization even when the lowered HOF body shape is similar;
- import binding and namespace lowering emits `Import` evidence for the proof RHS
  and `Symbol` evidence for the local alias identity;
- selected top-level Ruby literal `require "module"` calls that occur before a
  selected library API use emit `Import::Require` evidence for the required
  module, with an asserted `UnshadowedGlobal("require")` dependency;
- JS/TS static-global value occurrences that remain as `Var` nodes, such as
  member receivers, call callees, constructors, and `undefined`, emit
  `UnshadowedGlobal` symbol evidence when the frontend proves no local shadow;
- selected JS/TS qualified static global paths emit `QualifiedGlobal` symbol
  evidence at the lowered node anchor: own-property guards at their
  `Seq("own_property_guard")` node, and static member expressions such as
  `Array.from` and `Array.isArray` at their `Field` node;
- JS/TS own-property guard lowering emits `Guard::JsOwnProperty` evidence for
  the lowered `Seq("own_property_guard")`, with an asserted `QualifiedGlobal`
  dependency for the admitted API path;
- JS/TS record-shape guard lowering emits `Guard::JsRecordShape` evidence for
  the lowered `Seq("record_guard")`, including the shared subject hash, the
  null/truthiness clause kind, whether JS loose equality was admitted, and
  asserted dependencies for the required `Array.isArray` API proof plus optional
  `Boolean` proof;
- first-party lowering and normalize refreshes emit `Place(SelfReceiver)` for
  Java `this`, `Place(SelfField)` for Java `this.field`,
  `Effect(SelfFieldWrite)` for Java `this.field = ...`,
  `Effect(NonOverloadableIndexWrite)` for C/Go/Java index writes, and
  `Effect(BuilderAppendCall)` for canonical `Builtin::Append`. Self-field
  place/write evidence records include dependencies that link the write proof
  back to the receiver proof;
- first-party lowering emits `LibraryApi` evidence for selected API occurrences
  that remain as raw nodes: JS-like `Array.from(...)`, `Array.isArray(...)`,
  `Boolean(...)`, `new Map(...)`, `new Set(...)`, and static
  `indexOf`/`findIndex` membership calls whose receiver has collection
  sequence-surface proof; Python builtin collection factories such as
  `list(...)` when the callee has an unshadowed free-name proof; Python
  `collections.deque(...)` through imported binding/namespace proof; Python
  `math.prod(...)` through imported namespace proof; Rust
  `vec!(...)` when macro-invocation source syntax and macro-name shadow policy
  are proven, `Vec::new()`, `Some(...)`, `Some(_)` pattern selectors, bare
  `None`, and selected `std::collections::*::from(...)` factory paths when
  their root-shadow policy is proven; JS/TS/Java `length` property reads whose
  receiver proof is satisfied; Ruby
  earlier top-level `require "set"; Set.new(...)` through `Import::Require`
  plus unshadowed `require` and `Set` proof; Java `java.util` static
  factories/adapters including `List.of`, `Set.of`, `Arrays.asList`, `Map.of`,
  `Map.ofEntries`, `Map.entry`, and `Arrays.stream`, plus selected empty
  `new ArrayList<>()`/`new LinkedList<>()` constructors through exact or
  wildcard import proof; and JS-like regex-literal `.test(...)`. These records
  depend on the relevant `QualifiedGlobal`, `UnshadowedGlobal`,
  import-backed call-site `Symbol`, `Import::Require`, construct-syntax
  `Source`, `SequenceSurface`, or regex-literal `Source` evidence. Calls
  collapsed into specialized guard surfaces emit their guard evidence instead.
  Shadowed roots, unsupported arities, unsupported static paths, unresolved
  free-name/path factories, and Ruby require-backed APIs without require
  evidence do not emit API occurrence evidence;
- first-party lowering plus post-binding and final-normalization refresh passes
  emit `LibraryApi`
  occurrence evidence for selected receiver methods that remain as raw call
  nodes: map `get`, map-key views, iterator identity adapters, and the
  language-scoped method-call contracts currently used for collection/map
  membership, map defaulting, count, predicates, Rust scalar integer methods,
  Rust `Option::and_then`, Rust `zip`, HOF, and reduction methods. Property
  cardinality such as JS/TS `length` is modeled as `Property`, not as a method
  call. The post-binding refresh exists because immutable
  binding-domain evidence is inferred after lowering; the final refresh exists
  because CFG/dataflow/algebra rewrites can replace receiver expressions with
  equivalent sequence or result values. Refreshing upserts first-party occurrence
  records so `VALUES = List.of(...); VALUES.contains(x)` depends on the current
  binding or sequence-domain proof rather than falling back to selector
  matching;
- selected `LibraryApi` producer-covered result calls emit dependent
  receiver-expression `Domain` evidence: Python `list`/`tuple` and
  `collections.deque`, Rust `Vec::new`, `vec!`, and
  `std::collections::VecDeque::from`, Java `List.of` and zero- or multi-argument
  `Arrays.asList`, and selected empty `new ArrayList<>()`/`new LinkedList<>()`
  as `Collection`; Python `set`/`frozenset`, Rust
  `std::collections::{HashSet,BTreeSet}::from`, Java `Set.of`, Ruby `Set.new`,
  and JS-like `new Set` as `Set`; Rust
  `std::collections::{HashMap,BTreeMap}::from`, Java `Map.of`/`Map.ofEntries`,
  and JS-like `new Map` as `Map`; and JS-like one-argument `Array.from` as
  `Array`. `Map.entry`, `Array.isArray`, `Boolean`, regex `.test`,
  `math.prod`, `Arrays.stream`, map `get`, iterator adapters, promise `.then`,
  and generic method contracts do not emit `Domain` records because their
  results are not simple container receiver domains under the current
  vocabulary;
- lowered `Seq` surfaces emit `SequenceSurface` evidence, including Go map
  literal and Go map-entry surfaces where those tags carry first-party meaning.

Source-origin and parameter-domain proof no longer has side-table mirror storage:
frontends emit `Source` and `Domain` records directly, and semantic lookups are
evidence-only for those facts. First-party JS/TS record-shape guards now have
dedicated guard evidence, and exact-fragment append/index/self-field gates now
have the first place/effect evidence substrate. Broader guard families, richer
source-clause dependencies, richer receiver/place families, and general evidence
validation remain open.

## Current Consumers

The first migrated consumers are the shared semantic helpers and their direct
callers:

- source-fact lookup for construct syntax, async/generator/error and Go
  concurrency/channel protocol boundaries, Python comprehension surfaces, regex
  literal, and operator provenance;
- receiver-domain lookup used by post-desugar semantic/value-graph
  membership/property/map/integer gates and strict exact receiver gates.
  Consumers ask `nose-semantics` whether a receiver satisfies a
  `DomainRequirement`, so node-anchored receiver evidence, immutable
  local/module binding evidence, scoped parameter evidence, selected API
  result-domain evidence, ambiguity handling, and compatibility fallback are no
  longer reimplemented separately in those paths. Desugaring and early idiom
  canonicalization still run before immutable binding-domain inference, so they
  only consume the domain evidence already present at that point. Coarse API
  result-domain and binding-domain evidence is not exact-tree proof: value-graph
  consumers prefer concrete factory/result-shape canonicalization before using a
  domain-shaped fallback, and strict exact consumers still require the receiver
  expression itself to satisfy the relevant factory, literal, binding, or
  typed-variable safety contract;
- import proof parsing for compatibility helpers, with value-graph import
  identity and imported literal replacement consuming evidence-only facts;
- cross-file imported literal replacement copies the provider's closed evidence
  subgraph into the importer while preserving provider source-origin spans and
  rewiring dependency ids, then records `Import(ImportedLiteralSnapshot)`
  provenance that depends on the importer import proof and copied provider
  evidence;
- imported namespace/binding symbol proof for normalize idiom admission,
  value-graph namespace fallbacks, and strict exact gates, without raw assignment
  fallback;
- value-graph internal import identity now uses dedicated
  `ImportNamespace`/`ImportBinding` value ops derived from `Import` evidence, so
  raw import `Seq` payloads cannot hash-cons with proof-bearing import values;
- unshadowed-global symbol proof for JS/TS `Math.*` method contracts,
  `new Map(...)`/`new Set(...)` constructor contracts, static `Array.isArray`
  exact gates, and `undefined` nullish-default handling, with compatibility
  fallback only when no relevant evidence record exists;
- qualified-global symbol proof for selected JS/TS API paths: own-property
  guard evidence depends on `Object.hasOwn` or
  `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call`, and map-key view wrappers require
  evidence for `Array.from`;
- selected `LibraryApiContract` consumers now consult `LibraryApi` occurrence
  evidence first for the migrated JS-like, Python builtin/imported, Rust
  free-name/path/Option/scalar, Ruby require-backed, Java static/property,
  regex-literal, property, and receiver-method surfaces;
  conflicting or dependency-broken API evidence keeps
  the value-graph, idiom, and strict exact paths closed. Missing API evidence is
  now also closed for those producer-covered surfaces; older symbol/source proof
  helpers remain dependency inputs to `LibraryApi` evidence, not fallback API
  proofs. Other factory and constructor contract rows still name API
  identity/result semantics while local consumers prove their current `Symbol`,
  `Import`, `Source`, `Domain`, and `SequenceSurface` obligations;
- value-graph consumers that query by source span re-check the original source
  `Call` node shape and its evidence dependencies when that call can be
  recovered. This preserves receiver-method precision when value-graph CSE has
  collapsed a parameter receiver into a spanless input, and it still fails closed
  if the source span does not identify a matching call occurrence;
- normalized `HoF` nodes produced from admitted receiver-method calls preserve
  the same-span `LibraryApi(MethodCall(HoF(...)))` occurrence record as protocol
  receiver evidence. Downstream calls such as Rust `.collect()` can therefore
  depend on the admitted `filter_map`/`map`/`filter` occurrence after IL
  canonicalization, without reopening selector-only proof;
- JS/TS record-shape guard exact admission and value-graph tagging require both
  `SequenceSurface(RecordGuard)` and `Guard::JsRecordShape`; raw
  `Seq("record_guard")` cannot enter the proof-bearing exact/value-graph path by
  tag spelling alone;
- JS/TS own-property guard exact admission and value-graph map-default
  normalization require both `SequenceSurface(OwnPropertyGuard)` and
  `Guard::JsOwnProperty`; raw `Seq("own_property_guard")` plus a path-shaped
  spelling is not proof by itself;
- sequence-surface admission for normalize/value-graph/detect exact paths where
  the surface contract is independently exact-safe; guard surfaces use their
  dedicated guard helper instead. Go zero-map literal lookup also requires
  `SequenceSurface(GoCompositeMapLiteral)` and `SequenceSurface(GoMapEntry)`,
  so `composite_literal`/`keyed_element` tag spelling alone no longer admits the
  exact map-default path;
- exact-fragment append, non-overloadable index-write, and self-field-write
  gates now require `Effect`/`Place` evidence. Missing, ambiguous, conflicting,
  or dependency-broken evidence keeps the exact path closed.

Broader field/place/effect facts, promise receiver proof, async/sync and
Go-channel protocol convergence, unmodeled stdlib/ecosystem APIs, broader inferred
receiver-expression domain evidence, first-class mutation/effect evidence beyond
the current first-party binding scan, full protocol/demand/effect receiver
obligations for lazy generators, set/dict materialization, channels, and async,
full scope-resolution and namespace-member evidence, broader guard
evidence, general cross-module dependency manifests, report-level provenance,
and external manifest loading are still open work.
