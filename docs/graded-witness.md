# Graded equivalence witness

The exact `semantic` channel proves two units compute the same thing — *equal
fingerprint ⟹ equal behavior* ([design §1](design.md)). The `near` and shared-core
channels can still need explanation. The **graded witness** bridges that gap: for an
enriched near/shared-core family it computes the *least general
generalization* (anti-unification) of representative copies' value DAGs and reports
them as **equal except at *k* holes**, each hole carrying the specific value that
differs. It turns a bare `0.86` or a shared-sub-DAG anchor into a machine-checkable,
actionable statement — the lever for [consumer 1](design.md) (the calling agent reads
*what* differs instead of re-deriving it) and a graded surface for the
[review](divergent-edits.md) gate.

This is the productized outcome of the #315 investigation; the
[architecture](architecture.md) pipeline (step 5, scoring) emits it where a presentation
surface asks for the enrichment. `nose query` exposes it as `graded` on family JSON when
the query filters or groups by `spotclass`, along with `graded_pair` so consumers know
which two `locations[]` members were compared; scan-family witnesses use the same witness
schema under `witness.graded` when enriched.

## What it computes

Given the two copies' canonical [value graphs](normalization.md), the witness aligns
them node by node:

- nodes that match (equal structural hash) are shared — the body of the helper you
  would extract;
- each spot where they differ becomes a **hole** — a parameter of that helper.

Each hole is classified by what kind of value differs:

- **clean parameters** — `literal`, `input`, `field`, `call`, `lambda`, `operator`,
  `expr`: a value leaf an extracted helper could take as an argument;
- **structural divergence** — `arity`, `shape`, `unmodeled`, `extra-sink`: not a clean
  parameter (different number of operands, different shape, an unmodeled construct, or
  a behavior sink present on only one side).

`equal_modulo_holes` is the strongest grade: every hole is a small value leaf, the
behavior sinks aligned, and no consumed name mismatched. The exact channel is the
degenerate `k = 0` case; the experimental [`abstraction`](usage.md) witness is the
`k = 1` literal case.

## Patterns, not noise

Some divergences are better described than itemized as holes:

- `effects-reordered` — the two copies perform the same effect multiset in a different
  order (matched by an order-preserving LCS, so a pure reorder does not manufacture
  positional holes);
- `sink-superset-a` / `sink-superset-b` — one copy does strictly more (an extra
  return/effect) while the shared part is hole-free equal;
- `fragment-containment` — the smaller copy is a sliver of the larger (a containment,
  not a clone claim);
- `low-substance` — the units are too small for the claim to mean much.
- `async-mirror` — one copy crosses an async protocol boundary where the other does
  not: an async↔sync *transformation* twin (§K / experiments §CU). The witness
  build keeps supported boundaries such as `await e`, async-function return sinks,
  and Rust `async { ... }` values behind an `Opaque(VG_PROTOCOL_AWAIT,[value])`
  wrapper; the alignment recurses *through* it (matching the wrapped value against
  the bare sync value) and records the boundary as a one-sided hole. Always sets
  `equal_modulo_holes = false` — a coroutine is not its resolved value, so this is
  a refactoring lead, never a behavioral-equivalence claim. (The fingerprint
  build, by contrast, makes the supported async protocol boundary transparent so
  the twin's `vj` converges — see the dual view in `value_graph/eval/core.rs`.)

## Soundness — the referent check

Two copies can be node-for-node identical yet behave differently because a *name* they
both use denotes different things — `equals` on two unrelated classes, a same-named
locale table in two files, a per-package context key. The witness resolves every
consumed name to a content-based identity (a local definition by the content hash of
its body, an import by its `(module, exported)` coordinate, a self-call by a stable
marker) and compares:

- **`referent_mismatches`** — a name both copies consume that resolves to *disjoint*
  definitions. This **demotes** the witness: the copies are not equal-modulo-holes.
  Fail-closed — the soundness-relevant direction.
- **`caveat_names`** — a name unresolved on at least one side. The claim is *scoped*
  past it (a reviewer should confirm it denotes the same thing) rather than silently
  trusted; `modeled_caveat` flags the broader case where a copy passed lossy lowering,
  so "equal" means equal in the modeled fraction.
- **Definition-site modifiers.** A decorator/annotation/attribute (`@click.command(…)`,
  `@Test`, `#[inline]`) modifies behavior at the definition site, but its *arguments* are
  dropped at lowering — `@click.argument("x")` and `@click.argument("x", metavar="m")`
  produce the same value graph. Because the graph cannot see this, the witness compares
  the two copies' decorator/attribute **source lines** directly: any difference becomes a
  `decorator` hole (with the differing text), fires the `decorator-differs` pattern, and
  demotes `equal_modulo_holes`. This source-text comparison runs only when the selected
  representative pair is in the same language; cross-language pairs still get value-DAG
  grades when the graphs align, but do not compare decorator syntaxes across languages.
  (Language-aware: a leading `@` is a decorator in Python/Java/JS/TS and an *instance
  variable* in Ruby, where it is correctly ignored; Rust uses `#[…]`.)

A pair too large or too deep to align soundly yields **no** witness rather than a
guessed one.

## Ranking

The witness's hole count is, in principle, a more semantically-grounded "number of
parameters the helper would need" than the source-line [`varying_spots`](scan-json.md)
count the default [extractability](usage.md) ranking uses. Re-ranking by it was measured
on the gold set (`bench/labels/eval_by_language.py`, anti-unification re-rank vs the
extractability baseline): the effect is **within noise overall** (dev +2pp, held-out
−1pp P@10, CIs overlapping; it helps Java/Ruby/Rust and hurts Python/TypeScript). Per
the measure-before-betting discipline, the **default ranking is left unchanged** — the
witness is carried as machine-readable evidence so a consumer's own re-ranker can use it,
not folded into nose's deterministic order on a neutral signal.

## Scope and limits

- **Near/shared-core families whose value DAGs can be aligned.** Same-language pairs are
  the common case, but cross-language families can now be enriched when their canonical
  value DAGs share enough structure; source-line anti-unification, source-comparable
  removable-line accounting, and decorator/attribute comparison remain same-language
  surfaces. The witness is absent for sub-function fragments and pathological
  (generated/minified) files. Multi-member shared-core families keep the historical first
  representative pair unless another sampled pair exposes the specific async/sync
  `async-mirror` transformation that would otherwise be hidden by a decoy member. The
  `async-mirror` label is emitted when the alignment reaches a one-sided async protocol
  wrapper; lossy or opaque control regions can still surface as structural
  `modeled_caveat` witnesses before that wrapper is alignable.
- **The unit body, plus decorators by source — not the full signature.** The witness
  compares the two units' *value graphs* (the modeled body), augmented by the
  source-level decorator/attribute check above. What it does not model is the parameter
  **signature** — a differing *unused* parameter is invisible. This is a deliberate,
  sound boundary, not a gap: a parameter that the body *uses* already surfaces as a
  value-graph hole (it appears as an input the two copies bind differently), and a
  parameter the body *never reads* cannot change behavior, so omitting it leaves the
  "equal body ⟹ equal behavior" claim intact. Treat `equal_modulo_holes` as "equal
  within the modeled body and matching decorators".
- **The structural core is machine-checked; the referent gate is not.** The
  anti-unification core is now a `proven` Lean obligation, `detect.graded_witness` (see
  [formal soundness](formal-soundness.md)): both copies match their least general
  generalization (holes are the only freedom) and a hole-free generalization means the
  terms are equal. Like [`factor_distribute`](formal-soundness.md)'s Num gate, one
  precondition stays *empirical* and outside the proof — that names both copies consume
  resolve to the same referent (`compare_referents`), plus the decorator/sink checks.
  Those fail the family closed when violated and are defended by the witness soundness
  battery, not by Lean; treat `referent_mismatches`/`caveat_names` as the honest boundary
  of the claim.
- It is **best-effort enrichment**, computed at the presentation layer (which has
  source access), exactly like the line-level [`varying_spots`](scan-json.md) — the two
  describe the same divergence at the value-graph and source-line granularities
  respectively.
