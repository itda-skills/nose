# Continuous integration

nose is built to run in CI as a duplication gate. The pieces below turn the
report from [usage](usage.md) into a pass/fail check that flags only *new* duplication
and runs fast on every push.

## The `--fail-on any` gate

`--fail-on any` makes nose exit non-zero if **any** family survives the filters.
**A gate should pin `--mode` explicitly** rather than ride the default: the default mix
serves the report/agent surface and now includes fuzzy `near` candidates, and a pinned
mode keeps the gate's surface stable across nose upgrades. `--mode syntax` is the
closest jscpd replacement.

For a jscpd-style copy-paste gate:

```sh
nose scan src --mode syntax --fail-on any
```

For a broader exact gate, pin both exact channels and keep only substantial findings:

```sh
nose scan src --mode syntax,semantic --min-value 300 --min-members 3 --fail-on any
```

To include Type-3 near-duplicates in a review ratchet, add `near` and tune the fuzzy
threshold. This is usually better as a report or ratchet with `--min-value` than as a
bare "any finding fails" gate:

```sh
nose scan src --mode syntax,semantic,near:0.70 --min-value 300 --min-members 3 --fail-on any
```

For an exact semantic-only gate, use `--mode semantic`. It does not use a
similarity threshold.

With committed settings in `nose.toml`, the CI command can be just `nose scan src --fail-on any`.
If a wrapper needs to support multiple installed nose versions, have it query
`nose capabilities` first instead of scraping `--help`; the JSON contract is
documented in [capabilities](capabilities.md).

Use `--fail-on any` for a greenfield or low-noise gate. Use `--baseline` plus
`--fail-on new` when adopting nose on an existing codebase, so old accepted duplication stays
visible in the baseline while new or changed families fail the build.

## Local CI mirror

For nose itself, use the repository scripts before opening or updating a PR:

```sh
./scripts/check-ci-local.sh --fast
```

The fast gate runs rustfmt, clippy with `-D warnings`, the `nose-cli` test suite,
and the docs wiki lint. It is also wired into `.githooks/pre-push` when hooks are
enabled with:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

Before merge or release-sensitive work, run the full local CI mirror:

```sh
./scripts/check-ci-local.sh --full
# same as:
./scripts/check.sh
```

The full gate mirrors the GitHub Actions jobs: format, clippy, rustdoc warnings,
release build/tests, the `cargo-llvm-cov` coverage floor, the self-hosted
duplication gate, MSRV check, supply-chain checks, docs wiki connectivity, the
formal obligation registry, and Lean soundness proofs via
[check-lean-proofs.sh](../scripts/check-lean-proofs.sh).

The clippy complexity thresholds (`clippy.toml`) and the coverage floor
(`--fail-under-lines`) are deliberately **ratchets**: they start lenient so
today's code is green and are tightened over time, never loosened to pass a red
build. See [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the gate table and the current
values.

## External review bots

CodeRabbit repository automation is disabled with the root `.coderabbit.yaml`.
The file opts out of inherited CodeRabbit settings, turns off automatic and
incremental review, leaves no keyword/label trigger for review opt-in, excludes
all paths from review scope, disables review statuses, summaries, chat
auto-replies, finishing touches, pre-merge checks, issue enrichment, knowledge
base retention, external knowledge sources, and built-in review tools.

That YAML is the repository-owned control. CodeRabbit documents that manual
`@coderabbitai review` commands can still trigger a review regardless of
auto-review settings while the app has repository access. The CodeRabbit GitHub
App is installed at the `corca-ai` organization level, so a hard block still
requires an organization owner to change the app installation from "all
repositories" to a selected-repositories installation that excludes
`corca-ai/nose`, or to uninstall CodeRabbit from the organization.

## Baselines — incremental adoption

An existing codebase already has dozens of clone families, so a bare `--fail-on any`
gate is unusable on day one. A **baseline** records the currently-accepted
families; subsequent runs compare the current report to that accepted state, so
the gate can flag only duplication introduced *after* adoption.

```sh
# 1. Accept today's state (writes the baseline file and exits):
nose scan src --baseline .nose-baseline.json --write-baseline

# 2. From now on, show only NEW or CHANGED families:
nose scan src --baseline .nose-baseline.json

# 3. Make CI fail only when NEW or CHANGED families exist:
nose scan src --baseline .nose-baseline.json --fail-on new
```

`--baseline` by itself keeps the historical behavior and reports only families not
accepted by the baseline (the default whenever `--baseline` is present). Use
`--fail-on new` when you want a CI ratchet that ignores accepted debt but exits
non-zero for new or changed clone families. Plain `--fail-on any` still means "fail if
anything is reported after the active filters."

Commit `.nose-baseline.json`. Families are keyed by their sorted reported member
locations: displayed path, language, span, unit kind, symbol name, and fragment
metadata. **The key is deliberately span- and path-sensitive**, which has three
honest consequences (measured in [experiments §CB](experiments.md)): editing lines
*above* an accepted clone re-keys it (it resurfaces as `new`/`changed`); renaming
its file re-keys it; and the key embeds the detecting channel's unit shape, so a
baseline is only valid for the `--mode` it was written under — pin the mode in CI
and re-baseline after refactors that move accepted clones. Every drift direction
is loud (the gate fires; nothing is silently hidden). New baselines also record
those member identities next to the reviewable
note, which lets later scans classify exact matches as `unchanged`, overlapping
but re-keyed families as `changed`, missing accepted families as `resolved`, and
unmatched current families as `new`. Regenerate the baseline deliberately (re-run
`--write-baseline`) when you've paid down duplication and want the lower bar
locked in — it's a ratchet.

When `--baseline` is present, the file must exist and parse as a valid baseline.
Missing or malformed baselines are hard errors; otherwise a CI ratchet could
silently compare against an empty accepted state.

With `--format json`, the top-level `baseline` object carries those counts and each
reported family gets `baseline_status: "new"` or `"changed"`.

## Structured ignores — audited suppressions

Baselines accept the current state in bulk. Structured ignores are for individual
families that were reviewed and intentionally kept. Commit `nose.ignore.json`
next to the code, or point to another file with `--ignore-file` / `ignore-file`
in [configuration](configuration.md):

```sh
nose scan src --ignore-file nose.ignore.json --fail-on any
```

Ignored families are removed from the active report, so they do not fail `--fail-on any`
or `--fail-on new`. They are still present in `--format json` under
`ignored_families`, with the ignore entry's reason, note, owner, expiry, matched
selectors, and matched paths.

Malformed ignore files fail the run. Expired entries are reported as warnings and
listed in `ignore.expired`, but are not applied. That makes stale waivers visible
instead of silently hiding duplication. See [structured-ignores](structured-ignores.md)
for the file format and selector semantics.

## SARIF for code scanning

`--format sarif` emits SARIF 2.1.0, which GitHub code-scanning ingests to render
findings as inline PR annotations:

```sh
nose scan src --format sarif --top 0 > nose.sarif
# then upload nose.sarif via github/codeql-action/upload-sarif
```

**Pass `--top 0` for a complete upload.** `--top` (default 30) truncates *every*
output format, SARIF included — without `--top 0` a repo with more than 30 families
uploads only the first 30. The SARIF run records the full count in
`runs[].properties` (`total_families` / `shown_families`) and, when families were
hidden, adds a `note` notification under `runs[].invocations[]`, so a truncated upload
is at least detectable; `--top 0` avoids the cap entirely.

`--format json` is the general machine-readable form for any other tooling. Its
versioned contract is documented in [scan-json](scan-json.md); it is truncated by
`--top` in the same way.

## Fast re-runs: `--cache-dir`

`--cache-dir <dir>` caches each file's analysis keyed by content hash. Unchanged
files are reused on the next run — skipping parse, [normalization](normalization.md), and feature
extraction — which makes repeated invocations (CI, pre-commit, local iteration)
much faster. Point it at a directory your CI caches between runs.

```sh
nose scan src --cache-dir .nose-cache --fail-on any
```

## Nightly pinned-corpus verify

This repository also has a scheduled `.github/workflows/corpus-verify.yml` gate
for the soundness moat. Every night, and on manual `workflow_dispatch`, it
reconstructs the pinned benchmark corpus with `bench/setup_repos.sh`, verifies the
prune manifest, builds `target/release/nose`, and runs every corpus repository
through:

```sh
target/release/nose verify bench/repos/<repo> --max-violations 0
```

The runner is `scripts/corpus-verify-nightly.sh`. It shards by repository, keeps a
per-repo log under `target/corpus-verify-logs/`, writes a Markdown summary to the
GitHub step summary, and exits non-zero if any repo reports a hard false merge or
a canon-preservation change. Symbolic-trace disagreements stay in the advisory
lane: the summary counts them, but they do not fail the job.

On failure, the workflow uploads `target/corpus-verify-logs` as the
`corpus-verify-logs` artifact so triage starts from the failing repo output. The
workflow caches `bench/repos` with a key derived from the pinned corpus manifest
and prune scripts; a cold run still works because `bench/setup_repos.sh`
reconstructs any missing or drifted checkout.

For a local spot check:

```sh
./scripts/corpus-verify-nightly.sh --repo arrow --repo click --jobs 2
```
