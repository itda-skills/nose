//! Track 1 Stage 3 — value-graph / global value numbering (GVN).
//!
//! Symbolically evaluates a function unit into a DAG of *values*, hash-consed by
//! `(op, operand-value-ids)`. Because a variable maps to the value it currently
//! holds (not its name), and identical computations intern to one node:
//!
//! - temporaries and intermediate names dissolve (`t=a+b; …t…` ≡ inline),
//! - common subexpressions share a node (CSE),
//! - the order of data-independent statements stops mattering,
//! - commutative operands are canonical.
//!
//! Branches merge variables with `Phi(cond, then, else)`. Loops are approximated:
//! variables written in the body become opaque loop values (no fixpoint — bounded
//! and deterministic). Calls/stores are treated as values too (fuzzy: identical
//! calls CSE). The per-unit **fingerprint** is the multiset of value-node hashes
//! reachable from the unit's sinks (returns, throws, branch conditions, effects).
//!
//! This is a *detection substrate*, not an IL rewrite: it returns a fingerprint
//! the detector can use instead of (or alongside) subtree shapes.
//!
//! CONVENTION: a meaning-preserving *canonicalization* (a value rewrite) needs Lean evidence.
//! Name it `canonicalize_*` and list it in an obligation's `[rust].symbols` — the formal
//! obligation gate (`scripts/check-formal-obligations.py`) ENFORCES that every `canonicalize_*`
//! fn is covered by some obligation (the name is the declaration; no separate marker needed). A
//! canon under another name must be registered in that script's REQUIRED_OBLIGATIONS, or it
//! skips the gate (the gap that let `.then`/`pure_inline` slip).
//!
