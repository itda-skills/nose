//! Same-unit indexed-element read-forwarding for value-graph construction (#337).
//!
//! Unlike field state (`field_state.rs`), which is keyed by a non-aliasable `this`/`self`
//! receiver and flushed as order-INSENSITIVE place sinks, array indices CAN alias (two
//! distinct value nodes `i` and `j` may be equal at runtime), so a place-keyed, order-
//! insensitive model is UNSOUND for `a[i]`. The element WRITE therefore stays an ordered
//! effect (`push_effect`, order-sensitive — already sound). This module adds only READ-
//! FORWARDING: a `base[index]` read evaluated AFTER a write to that exact (base, index) place
//! returns the written value, so `clobber` (`a[i]=a[j]; a[j]=a[i]`) — whose second read sees
//! the first write — fingerprints distinctly from `swap` (`t=a[i]; a[i]=a[j]; a[j]=t`).
//!
//! Soundness under aliasing is conservative: ANY indexed write clears the entire forwarding
//! map before recording the just-written place, so a read only forwards when its place was
//! the most recent write with no intervening (possibly-aliasing) write. This errs toward
//! FEWER forwards (more distinct nodes), which can only cost recall, never soundness.
//!
//! The `nose verify` soundness oracle backs this empirically: it interprets in-place element
//! mutation in lockstep (`interp.rs` `bind` for `Index`) and would witness any false merge.
//!
//! proof-obligation: normalize.value_graph.index_writes
