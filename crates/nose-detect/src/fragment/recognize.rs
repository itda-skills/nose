//! The contract-path recognizer and its differential gate against the shape predicates.
//!
//! Issue #33 steps 4–5. As each fragment family migrates off the standalone shape
//! predicates in [`crate::units`], its recognition is re-expressed here as the
//! construction of a [`FragmentContract`]. [`recognize_contract`] is an *independent*
//! recognizer for the migrated shapes: it matches structure directly and builds a contract,
//! reusing only the shared invalidation-boundary gates (span containment + context safety),
//! which are substrate, not per-shape predicates.
//!
//! The differential test below is the acceptance gate the maintainer required: over a
//! representative corpus, the set of `(span, kind)` the predicate path accepts (restricted
//! to migrated kinds) must equal the set the contract path produces. A migration step that
//! changes which nodes are accepted fails this test. As the migrated set grows, the gate
//! keeps the two paths in lockstep until every shape is contract-expressed.
