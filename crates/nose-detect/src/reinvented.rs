/// an equal value-graph node hash is the same hash-consed canonical-structure guarantee
/// the exact channel rides — the container's sub-computation and the helper's body are
/// the same computation, not merely similar. Units that *call* a helper with this
/// behavior (directly, or via a behaviorally-equal twin) are excluded — calling is the
