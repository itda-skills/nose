"""Audit Swift stdlib partial-coverage prevalence in the pinned corpus.

This is a lexical pricing report, not semantic proof. It masks comments and
strings before counting common Swift collection factories, sequence HOFs,
cardinality properties, ordering/view APIs, and mutation/effect methods. The
report separates currently covered-partial surfaces from capability buckets that
should stay closed until the semantic kernel has reusable proof.
