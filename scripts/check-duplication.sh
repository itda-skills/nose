# Duplication gate — nose dogfooding itself.
#
# Fails when the number of *substantial* duplicate families on nose's own source
# (refactoring value >= MIN_VALUE) exceeds BUDGET. This is a ratchet: the current
# accepted families are all reviewed and recorded in docs/Dogfooding.md (e.g. the
# borrow-blocked `generic` node-copy). To accept a genuinely new one, either dedupe
# it or raise BUDGET in this file with a one-line justification in the PR.
#
# Runs only the `near` channel: this gate is about *design-level* Type-3 duplication
# (families worth extracting), not the syntax copy-paste floor — which always surfaces
# the reviewed-and-accepted per-grammar frontend parallelism (see docs/Dogfooding.md).
