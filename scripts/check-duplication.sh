# Duplication gate — nose dogfooding itself.
#
# Fails when the number of *substantial* duplicate families on nose's own source
# (refactoring value >= MIN_VALUE) exceeds BUDGET. This is a ratchet: the current
# accepted families are all reviewed and recorded in docs/dogfooding.md (mostly
# intentional per-grammar frontend parallelism). To accept a genuinely new one,
# either dedupe it or raise BUDGET in this file with a one-line justification in the PR.
#
# Runs only the `near` channel: this gate is about *design-level* Type-3 duplication
# (families worth extracting), not the syntax copy-paste floor — which always surfaces
# the reviewed-and-accepted per-grammar frontend parallelism (see docs/dogfooding.md).
#
# DETERMINISM: the count is reproducible run-to-run AND across platforms — nose hashes with
# FxHash (no random seed) and ranks with IEEE correctly-rounded ops only (+ - * / sqrt), and the
# family dedup sorts by a TOTAL order (span, value, then min source location). So CI and a local
# run report the SAME number; a count change is a real detection change (new duplication or a
# grammar/parse difference), never platform jitter. If they ever disagree, suspect a stale binary
# or a tree-sitter grammar version skew — not nondeterminism.

MIN_VALUE=40   # ignore small/incidental similarity; gate only on substantial families
# Re-baselined 6 → 20 in PR #82: that PR STRENGTHENS the `near` channel (value-fingerprint
# candidates + high-vj acceptance for impure code, and sub-DAG anchor pairing), so nose now
# detects 14 additional PRE-EXISTING near-duplicate families in its own source — the cross-grammar
# frontend helpers and the `proven_*` value-graph factories — not new code introduced here. They
# are dedup candidates (see docs/dogfooding.md); the gate stays a ratchet against NEW duplication
# on top of this stronger detector.
# 20 → 21: weight-grading the sub-DAG score (a larger shared computation now scores higher, up to
# 0.90) lifts one PRE-EXISTING partial-clone family in nose's own source past the substantial
# (value ≥ 40) line — finer ranking surfacing real debt, not new code. Still a dedup candidate.
# 21 → 22: receiver-method LibraryApi occurrence evidence makes the near channel admit one
# PRE-EXISTING param-domain/binding helper family; new occurrence-producer duplication was deduped.
BUDGET=22      # accepted substantial families today (see docs/dogfooding.md)
